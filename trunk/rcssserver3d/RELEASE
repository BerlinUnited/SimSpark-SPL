RELEASE News of rcssserver3d-0.6.7

This is the RoboCup 2013 release. It comes with some bug fixes, and also
compatibility with latest Boost libraries. New foulds and new debugging
facility are provided. Now, fouls are sent to the monitor so that it can
provide visual feedback about them. Finally, support for heterogeneous robots
is added and two sample types are provided. 

* Heterogeneous Players:
  This release supports heterogeneous players. Currently, two extra Nao robots
  are provided beside the standard Nao (thanks Stefan and Klaus).
  
  - Usage: to use the new heterogeneous players, a new scene command should be
  used. While the old style scene commands work, for using hetero players you
  should send "(scene rsg/agent/nao/nao_hetero.rsg TYPE_NO)", in which TYPE_NO
  is the type number of the player type. Type 0 is the standard type, and
  hetero types start from 1. Therefore, to load Nao type 1 the following
  command should be sent: (scene rsg/agent/nao/nao_hetero.rsg 1). Notice that
  you can use the new style command for loading standard Nao, using 0 as
  TYPE_NO.
  
  - Heterogeneous Robot Parameters: The robot parameters for different types
  are defined in a new file: "naorobottypes.rb". New types can be added to the
  array. But to define new parameters, corresponding .rsg files should be
  modified.
  
  - Rules: Each team can use a limited number of hetero players. The limits
  can be configured in naosoccersim.rb using "MaxTotalHeteroCount" and 
  "MaxHeteroTypeCount" variables. The former limits the total number of hetero
  players for each team, and the latter specifies the maximum number of players
  of a single hetero player type.

* Other Features/Changes:
  - Charging fouls rules are added (thanks Patrick). These fouls are not
  penalized, but recorded and sent to the monitor. New rules can be configured
  in naosoccersim.rb.
  - Fouls are added to the monitor protocol to provide visual feedback about
  them to viewers.
  - For debugging purposes, sensing the orientation of the agent can be 
  enabled using "setSenseMyOrien" option in the .rsg file of an agent (added 
  by Patrick)
  - A player can kick the ball in kickoff if there are only 2 players in
  the field to support current penalty mode.
