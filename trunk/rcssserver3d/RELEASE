RELEASE News of rcssserver3d-0.6.10

This is the final release of rcssserver3d for RoboCup 2015, which brings a few
bug fixes and enhancements for the competitions:
   * Turning off penalty shootout mode as soon as a goal is scored by the left
     team so that a later second goal won't be recorded if the goalie leaves
     the penalty area after the goal was scored.
   * Added models for visually differentiating between different robot body
     types.  This changes some of the black coloring on the robot's body to be
     a different type dependent neutral color.
   * Fixed bug where the server may hang on certain systems if beam effector
     noise (BeamNoiseXY and BeamNoiseAngle) are set to 0.
