Please see doc/users/user-manual.pdf and NEWS.

General Information

rcssserver3d is a 3D soccer simulation server running on top of simspark
simulation system. 
The simspark simulation system was created with a specific simulation in mind,
that is a 3D physical soccer simulation for RoboCup Simulation
league. To this end, this distribution contains a set of plugins for
RoboCup Soccer Simulation League. The soccer simulator can be found
in the ./simspark subdirectory.

If you installed rcssserver3D-0.x before, make sure to clean

better remove the old installed libraries in /usr/local/lib/
rcssserver3D manually. Sorry for this inconvenience.
