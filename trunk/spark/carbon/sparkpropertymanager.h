 \brief A class assigned to a SparkProperty::SparkPropertyList. Manages registration and application of SparkProperty::PropertyControl derived classes.

 \todo It is thinkable to use different front-ends for SparkProperties.
 In this case it would be cleaner and a bit more efficient to only have one PropertyManager designed as single Plugin that is loaded with ass the Plugins
 that need it, or better even to move the whole Property-System into a Plugin instead of having it in the main Gui.
 This would also reduce the initialization complexity for new SparkProperty::PropertyControl derived classes with searching and registering to the PropertyManager.

 \todo Currently SparkProperty::PropertyControl are not allowed to offer Properties for the same class.
 The first PropertyControl that supports a given calss will be chosen as default control to generate and execute the Property.
 This could be extended to have different implementations of properties or combine different properties for the same class from different plugins.
 However, because this might in some cases be really confusing for the user without having a good visual feedback, this feature was intentionally not
 allowed at this point.
