/*!
 \brief AttachableFrame plugin that allows loading, creating and saving SimulationSetups as contained in the SimulationManager.

 The Frame displays all Setups loaded in the SimulationManager. The setups can be reloaded, changed, initialized and executed.
 Setups can be explored in three tabs: Server, Tasks (threads and processes) and Gui-Plugins.
 They control the executables, scripts, references, parameters, plugins to load or unload and properties for every Setup.
 Values are always checked to be legal and meanuingful. Whenever a value is changed the frame will ask to save the changed setup before switching
 the setup or terminating the program.
 Explorer views show the file system to search and include script and executable paths from the respective include directories of the
 SimulationManager.

 SetupFrame works with definitions for Tasks (TaskDefinition), SimulationSetups (SimulationSetup) and Plugins (PluginDefinition).
 The currently selected SimulationSetup is contained in mCurrentSetup.\n

 As usual much of the functionality works using the signals and slots defined in the UI. So they update automatically whenever relevant changes
 have been made.
 Functions that edit whole parts of the gui and call one update afterwards, or those that might cause circular calls, use a simple
 guard mReactToChangeSetup that causes most of the other set-value functions to return immediately.
 When using the guard, make sure to not to rely on it being set when calling a function that sets/resets it itself.

 \note Before editing or debugging anything, make sure to inspect the connections using the QtDesigner.

 \warning
 Calling any slots from the outside has to be done with great care. Not all of the functions are safe to be used as standalone and in worst case
 might cause the frame to reach an illegal state.

 Generally, all the update-slots are always safe to use as they only update the view from the current setup. Changing a setup from the SimulationManager
 wont affect the SetupFrame because it uses a local copy of the edited SimulationSetup. Reloading with reloadSetups() will safely update the
 whole view.
