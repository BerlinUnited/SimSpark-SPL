 \brief A Qt Model/View tree model for a zeitgeist tree.

 Has a reference to the spark tree root node and a representative SparkTreeItem tree. The representative tree is essentially a copy or
 proxy model of the tree structure with all the formatted data to be displayed in the view. Every node contains a weak reference to the
 zeitgeist node and can therefore check if the node is still available or not and lock and access to it if needed.\n

 A Proxy model allows reacting to any call to the model with a simple casting of the contained zeitgeist::Leaf pointer and creating a new
 model index with the parent/child or childCount and the new pointer respectively, instead of recursively calling functions like rowCount() or
 parent() up to the root node. This also prevents synchronization issues between the proxy model and the zeitgeist tree. We can always investigate
 the tree at a given state and check if a node has been deleted any time without having it suddenly vanish from the displayed proxy model.\n

 The SparkTreeModel can be updated via updateModelData(), efficiently re-searching the zeitgeist tree and updating the proxy model.
 When updating, all SparkTreeItems referencing a vanished zeitgeist::Leaf will be removed from the proxy model, so dont store any references
 to these items.\n

 \todo To give feedback on which elements have been deleted the item deletion handling could be extended. When a zeitgeist::Leaf is removed and this is
 registerd by the SparkTreeModel during the next update, instead of deleting the SparkTreeItem right away there could be a delete flag set for the item.
 If a deleted item is currently selected its color in the assigned view could be changed to red to show the user that this node was removed without
 simply removing the node and taking away the focused object he wanted to inspect.
 Further extending, the SparkTreeModel could store deleted items temporarily, changing their display color and removing them after a short time,
 like with a process manager. The items in the view will briefly  change their color and then vanish. This way the user gets efficent feedback
 about how the scene graph is changing in a dynamic environment.
