 \brief Manages a selection of a zeitgeist::Leaf tht can be shared and creates a context menu.

 \todo Class is incomplete because it was not needed yet. The only selection sharing is done between monitor and scene graph plugin via
 the relative path. For more complex management of selections and creation of context menus for example in the gui monitor or for
 management (storing/loading/searching) of different selections this class should be completed with multiple selection, selection types
 and so on.
