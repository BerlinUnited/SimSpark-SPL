RELEASE News of simspark-0.1

This is the first release of the simulator after RoboCup 2008 competitions,
and the first release of simspark core simulation package as a separate
package.
In this release, MaxStepsPerCycle have been reduced to 1, so the simulation
time spent in each cycle is fixed. As a result, the performance of the agents
should not depend on the simulator speed, and they should be able to sense/act
in fixed simulation time steps.
This package provides a generic simulation framework and does not contain any
soccer features. To use the soccer simulator, you should install rcssserver3d
package which depends on this package. 
Also, we do not use autotools for our build system anymore. You should use
CMake (version 2.6) to build the package. See INSTALL for further installation
instructions.

You can get the package on the Simspark page on SourceForge
at http://sourceforge.net/projects/simspark/
