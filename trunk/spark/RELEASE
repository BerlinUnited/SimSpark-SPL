RELEASE News of simspark-0.2.1

This release of simspark is prepared for RoboCup 2010 competitions in Singapore.
In this release you can find some bug and compilation fixes, improved Windows
support and some new features such as the potential of using different 
physical simulation engines.

* New features:
 - The core physics system does no longer depend on ODE (Thanks to Andreas). 
 ODE implementation is now provided as a plugin.
   
* Fixes:
 - Compilation fixes on newer compilers (VS 2010)
 - Fixed some bugs on 64 bit systems and in multi-threaded mode. It is (hopefully)
   possible to run multi-threaded games while logging is enabled

You can get the package on the Simspark page on SourceForge
at http://sourceforge.net/projects/simspark/
