RELEASE News of simspark-0.3.0

This release comes with a new library: carbon. The carbon library contains a
gui-framework and a simulation-framework which wraps simspark using qt.
Its main features are:
 - Offering a graphical user interface which can be extended
   by visual and functional plugins. The plugins can be used
   to write easy-to-use interfaces to simspark simulations.
 - Creating, managing and executing simspark-simulations
   alongside with any additional threads and processes.
 - The gui can be altered flexibly. Its main window with
   "attachment points" is loaded from a shared library, and
   its used plugins are loaded from shared libraries too.
   Plugins with visual representation can be attached to the
   Gui.

You can get the package on the Simspark page on SourceForge
at http://sourceforge.net/projects/simspark/
