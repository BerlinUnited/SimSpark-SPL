
If you want to use these buttons in you own work that is not for personal use only (such as visual styles, desktop themes etc.),
you must ask for permission before you do so for these: 

 Aqua
 LH - LHS
 NX - NX1
 NX - NX2
 STYLE - NN
 STYLE - Style

You will not need permission for the other buttons, 
but I would like to get an e-mail with the link to your work: peterverschoor@xs4all.nl
