[0.5.2]
This is mainly a bug fix release to get a stable version and change some parameters
for the RoboCup-2006 in Bremen. Some new features, mainly in the monitor are
introduced as well.

* Features (general):

- the catch margin of the catch effector has been reduced to 0.8m and the goal
  height was increased to 1.6m to reflect the stronger goalie capabilities and
  offside rule implications.
- the monitor features a new autocam mode, "picture-in-picture" view, a
  display of the current camera mode, and the ground texture can be toggled
- logfiles can now be stepped backwards
- agenttest was updated with a say command and sample code

* Important fixes:

- the calculation of the torque vector in the kickeffector was fixed
- the parameters for the pan/tilt effector are checked for NAN
- the list of the monitor keybindings was updated
- a bug in offside was fixed that could occur if a player and the ball cross the
  opponents line of defense, and this player was the last one to shot the ball
  before crossing.
- the code has been updated for gcc 4.1
- some bugs relating to kickoff have been fixed
- say effector ignores some illegal characters


[0.5.1]
Release 0.5.1 contains mainly two fixes:
- the Offside rules are now closer to the FIFA rules. 
- the RestrictedVisionPerceptor (RVP) was hardly useable. The RVP 
  can now be controlled by using a PanTilt Effector.


[0.5]
This release introduces a few new features, and also some bugfixes 
(and probably some new bugs :). Important new features and fixes are 
as follows:

* Features (soccer):

- Goalies. 
  Players with uniform number '1' can catch the ball using the (catch) 
  command. 

- A restricted vision perceptor, so that not all other agents are
  visible at the same time. With this perceptor, the communication
  introduced in the 0.4 release becomes important.

- The offside and some other rules have been cleaned up and some bugs
  have been removed. Also, files that have been missing in the
  0.4. release are now present.

- rcssmonitor3D-lite looks a little more interesting now, and 
  some bugs with the random number generators have been fixed.

* Features (general):

- a couple of new physics functions have been added, general simulation 
  settings have been fixed. This doesn't change the current soccer 
  simulation, but is important for the general simulator.


[0.4]
This release includes some speed improvements, agent communication,
an implementation of the offside rule, and a first, unfinished version
of the new legged-sphere agent type amongst other things. 
Here is a summary with some more details:

* Features (general):

- A cache for node references has been added to the Zeitgeist
  core to speed up the simulation considerably. Thanks go to the
  Brainstormers3D team for the initial patch and to Markus Rollmann
  for the modification and integration.
- The Spark based simulation (which will be used in the future for
  simulations using the articulated agents) has been made much more
  flexible by Markus Rollmann.
- A sample agent and behaviors for a Spark based soccer simulation
  using either small cars or legged-sphere agents has been
  added. Currently, the legged-sphere agents are used by default. 
  The behavior of the agents is very simple (in the legged-sphere case) 
  and is solely meant to demonstrate how to use the new perceptors and 
  effectors.

* Features (soccer):

- The offside rule has been implemented by Hesham Ebrahimi
- Agent communication is now possible. It is based on the
  2D communication model. Documentation can be found in the
  file doc/TEXT_INSTEAD_OF_A_MANUAL.txt. Thanks go again to
  Hesham Ebrahimi for the implementation and documentation
- The lite-monitor is able to draw velocities in 2D and 3D. 
  Added by Jan Murray.

* Important fixes:

- Fix for gcc 4.0 and above compatibility by Jan Murray
- An issue with 64bit builds, reported by Li Yang and Patrick Riley,
  was fixed by Markus Rollmann
- The distance error in the vision perceptor was made dependent on the
  real distance by Oliver Obst

[0.x.x]
This release has been ported to OS X.  Besides the normal
requirements, it requires an X server to be installed on the machine,
along with a glut library for X windows.

[0.3]
This release is intended to be used as official version on RoboCup 2004.
With respect to the soccer rules, this release mainly fixes some bugs contained
in the 0.2.2 release. New things here are both an automatic and a manual drop 
ball feature and physical goal posts.
With respect to the simulation system itself and usability, a few keys have 
been added to the rcssmonitor3d-lite and the system shuts down automatically
after a match is over. Printing messages is turned off by default now (can be
changed by adding log streams from a ruby file).
Bugs that have been fixed included some math things (like a bug in the setup of
axis aligned bounding boxes), bugs in the use of SPADES, and in the sample 
agent communication server.

[0.2.2]
This release adds both soccer simulation specific features (like better rules 
 and an initial version of a logplayer) and general simulation features 
(almost all ODE features are supported now, and an initial version of an
alternative simulation server as a SPADES replacement). For the 0.3 release,
some of these new features need some polishing :-). Below a short summary of 
new features. 

* Features (soccer):

- The rcssmonitor3D protocol has been changed to produce less redundant data. 
  Specifically, field flags will only be sent once, and information like team 
  names and scores will be sent only if they change.
- rcssmonitor3D-lite can be used as a logplayer now. To do this, replace the 
  CommServer plugin setup in rcssserver3D-lite.rb by the LogfileServer setup.
  Monitor logfiles get recorded by SPADES automatically, and the new monitor
  protocol can be used as Logfile format.
- The rcssmonitor3D - library got an user-friendly interface.
- rcssmonitor3D-lite looks better now and the display is more informative.
- The body and effector parameters have been changed based on suggestions from
  the mailing lists.
- A trainercommandparser has been added so that it is possible to use soccer
  monitor applications as trainer program (to repoduce specific situations etc).
- Players are moved away from the ball in certain situations (like kick in for 
  the other team or kick off, etc).
- It is possible to do automatic kick offs now (in rcssserver3D.rb).
- Due to various improvements and changes, the simulator is now reasonable fast
  to extend the half time length to 4 minutes; suggestions for the competition 
  match lenght are welcome. 
- Players accelerate (and break) faster; something like air resistance or 
  friction was added to the players and the ball so that they eventually stop 
  with no acceleration.
- The torque from the kicker was made configurable from rcssserver3D.rb
- An experimental say-effector has been added; up to now, only monitors 
  (and trainers implemented as monitors) can hear the messages.

* Features (general):

- Several types of ODE joints are supported now.
- An initial version of a generic simulation server has been added. It 
  reimplements some of the more general SPADES concepts (like network support 
  and a run loop). It is intended to use it as an alternative to SPADES when 
  reproducibility of events is not key. The advantage is that faster 
  simulations (or simulations with more agents) are possible by less overhead.
- A general description language for 3D simulations has been added. By using
  this description language, it is possible to set up different 3D simulations
  based on text configuration files. Simulations are described by sets of 
  S-Expressions (any other format possible by changing plugins).
- The ScriptServer has been changed so that ruby functions can also read back
  values from the simulator easily.
- Body controllers have been introduced. Body controllers can be used to 
  constrain/control the motion of associated bodies (things like adding drag 
  forces or changing the "bouncyness" of objects can be controlled).
- Added a tool that visualizes the internal zeitgeist class hierarchy.
- Added a new library libspark that contains an application framework for
  applications using both liboxygen and libkerosin classes. 
- Added a new application SimSpark. SimSpark is a monolithic simulator bases
  on libspark. With this new simulator, we have been testing most of the new
  generic features (like the description language and ODE joints) we have been
  adding. 
- Got rid of the rcssbase package dependency. The "net" part of this package
  is part of rcssserver3D now and has been extended by TCP sockets. The list 
  of required libraries should be reasonable small now.
- Added simspark demo simulations. 

* Important fixes/Changes (both soccer specific and general):

- The simulator compiles with recent versions of boost (tested with 1-31-0).
- Goals are properly counted now.
- Goals are only 50cm heigh now because agents cannot jump high. 
- The default torque from the kicker is low now (was way to high before).
- Building the API documentation has been reduced to only the necessary cases.
- Some math bugs in libsalt have been fixed.
- The kerosin library has been overhauled (lights / meshes / etc).
- Added support to update cached script variables after reading ruby files.

[0.2.1]
This is a bugfix release. It removes some (but not all) bugs found
in rcssserver3D-0.2.

- Configuration was made a little stricter and more complete so that
  it should be easier to install the whole thing.
- The missing agenttest.rb file is included into the distribution
- The Makefile.am's have been fixed for those not building the libkerosin part.
- A fix for the recent SPADES versions has been added.
- A major bug with the weight of objects in the simulation has been removed.
  The dynamics of the drive of the robots and of the kicker have been adapted.
  (This bug was found after a report from Nuno Lau on the sserver list).
- The artificial slowdown of bodies has been removed. 
- The default timer of the sample agents (agenttest) is now jiffies.

A few features have been added to the zeitgeist library. This is mostly stuff 
dealing with the ruby interface.


[0.2]
This release adds already big parts of the soccer specific parts to the 
simulator. All soccer specific things are realized as plugins to the 
simulator, they are located in the soccer bundle in plugin/soccer/.

- rcssmonitor3D and soccer simulation:
  Starting with our simple monitor: here are the most visible changes.
  You can see a soccer field with two goals, a ball and agents in different
  colors dependend on the side they are playing on. 
  You can use keys 'a', 's,', 'd', and 'w' to move the camera (as was as 
  the mouse). The monitor can send simple commands to the simulator now.
  ('k' is of kick off, that is what you probably wanted to know).
  The soccer field is a standard FIFA size field with variable size, same with
  the ball and goals.
- Soccer Plugins
  Here is the really big part of the changes. Agents have an (omni-)drive and 
  a kicker now, they can perceive the environment with a kind of 360° omnicam
  and they get updates about the game state and things like the battery state.
  Using the omnidrive, agents can do 100m in something about 13s or 14s.

On startup, the simulator will start two different types of agents now. Even 
though there are only a few soccer rules implemented, it should be possible
to implement a simple soccer team. To facilitate programming a new team, we 
enhanced the sample client a bit. 

Finally, we added a small text (lacking a comprehensive manual),
describing the basic features of the simulated robots in the simulation. 

[0.1]
This is the initial release of rcssserver3D. To get an idea of what
rcssserver3D provides in general, please see also the file README.

- liboxygen / libkerosin
  libkerosin, the library containing the big part of the simulation
  system has been split up. We have now liboxygen containing the
  pure simulator part, and libkerosin containing the graphical output,
  user input and stuff like this. Because of issues with different
  OpenGL drivers, libkerosin is currently not used for graphical
  output. Another advantage of the split into liboxygen and libkerosin
  is that we can have a standalone simulator with no graphics.
  By default, libkerosin will not be build (if you want to build it
   anyway: libkerosin needs a few other libaries. See the
   documentation for details).

- SPADES integration
  For handling agents as external processes, we integrated SPADES into
  the simulator. SPADES is a middleware system for agent-based
  distributed simulation and was introduced by Patrick Riley on the 
  RoboCup 2002 symposium. Among other things, the simulator gets a
  model of simulation time and support for external monitors by using
  SPADES.  

- GameControlServer
  We added a GameControlServer as central instance for keeping
  information and classes relevant to agents in a simulation. An
  important part of the GameControlServer is a reference to a 
  parser responsible for parsing messages from agents into an internal
  representation. Parsers can be plugged in into the
  GameControlServer, so the simulator does not depend on a fixed
  protocol. Parsers are also responsible for generating messages from
  the internal representation.

- S-Expressions parser
  As a specific instance of a pluggable parser, we implemented a
  parser for parsing and generating S-Expressions (lists as used in 
  functional programming languages like LISP or Scheme). We also
  discussed using XML as protocol between agents and simulator. There
  was no clear joint position for or against XML or
  S-Expressions. There is no XML parser module now because noone
  implemented it :)

- CreateEffector
  We added a CreateEffector. The idea behind the CreateEffector is
  that once the agents connected to the simulator, they do not have a
  physical representation, other effectors or perceptors yet. By using
  the CreateEffector, agents can request specific effectors,
  perceptors, and bodies. Right now, the create effector requests a
  default agent with a perfect vision sensor, a simple force effector,
  an InitEffector for changing the team name, and a sphere like body.

- simple external monitor
  To get an impression of what actually happens we implemented a
  simple external monitor based on simple OpenGL stuff (it does not
  use our libkerosin library). The external monitor also uses
  sexpressions as syntax. The protocol is even more preliminary 
  than the agent protocol...

- a simple external SPADES agent
  We also implemented a very simple agent as sample implementation for
  external agents. The sample agent does (almost) nothing.

[Demo]

Physical Simulator as shown on RoboCup 2003 symposium
=====================================================
- libzeitgeist
  A class object system as core of the simulation system. A class
  object is just a factory of class instances. In addition to this
  mechanism, it also implements an object hierarchy. This hierarchy is
  essentially a virtual file system, where the 'directories' and
  'files' are instances of C++ classes. These two concepts are quite
  intertwined with each other, as class objects can also live inside
  the object hierarchy. Objects within the hierarchy are identified
  with a unique name. Class objects can also be loaded as plugins
  (loadable modules).

- libkerosin
  A physical simulator for simulation of rigid body dynamics based on
  ODE. We created a library that contains the big part of the
  simulator including visualization, physics, geometry, agents. We can
  also handle user input and playing sounds. The simulator library
  build upon the class object system mentioned above.

- demo
  A demo application with some spheres as agents. Agents try to get
  some food. The agents are part of the simulator loop; a simulation
  step is over if all agents finished thinking. Because of this, agents
  have infinite thinking time (in priciple). There is no model of time.
