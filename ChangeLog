	* Moved everything done so far into a separate branch
	(genesis). Added code from Diploma Thesis of Marco Kögler
	<kögler@uni-koblenz.de>, which provides an already running
	and flexible simulator for physical 3D simulations. The initial
	version is running on MS Windows, so one of the tasks is to
	provide Makefiles and changes to compile a Linux version. 

	* In the main branch, removed all ChangeLog entries for the
	"genesis" branch from the ChangeLog so that the old entries do not
	cause confusion here. Code and changes for the genesis branch were
	due to Oliver Obst <fruit@uni-koblenz.de> and
	Tom Howard <tomhoward@users.sourceforge.net>.
