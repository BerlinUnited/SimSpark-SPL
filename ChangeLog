	* ./utility/classserver/classserver.h
	* ./utility/classserver/classserver.cc
	Added initial revision of the ClassServer subsystem.
	To load dynamic libraries on demand, the class server
	should be compiled as a dynamic library (.so on normal
	systems or .dll on windows).
	
	* ./utility/forwarder/forwarder.h
	* ./utility/forwarder/forwarder.cc
	Added initial revision of Forwarder output stream

	* ./utility/forwarder/forwarderstreambuf.h
	* ./utility/forwarder/forwarderstreambuf.cc
