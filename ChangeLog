	* lib/zeitgeist/leaf.cpp, lib/zeitgeist/object.cpp: 
	- got rid of using the obsolete get() method from boost::weak_ptr<> 
	by using an additional boost::shared_ptr<> similar to the way used 
	for the Class class.

	* lib/zeitgeist/class.cpp: 
	- fixed use of boost::weak_ptr<>.get(), which was removed from the
        weak_ptr interface in recent versions of boost. The problem was
	fixed by assigning a shared_ptr for the get() operation.	
	- fixed use of deleting a boost::weak_ptr<> from a std::list. The
	problem here is that std::list<>.remove() was used, which needs an
	operator ==. (weak_ptr<> do not provide the == operator anymore). 
	The problem was fixed by using std::list<>.erase() for each element 
	that points to the same Object.

	* lib/zeitgeist/class.h: 
	fixed use of hash_map vs map: class uses a hash_map if found by 
	configure, otherwise the std::map is used for this. class.h has to 
	include the config.h file (like all the other classes also should do)

	* lib/kerosin/renderserver/renderserver.h,
          lib/kerosin/renderserver/renderserver.cpp:
	added a render server responsible for the actual rendering of a
	scene. (stuff coming from sceneserver)

	* lib/kerosin/sceneserver/sceneserver.h,
	  lib/kerosin/sceneserver/sceneserver.cpp:
	moved OpenGL specific stuff to a new class 'renderserver' so that
	a pure simulator can be build without using any opengl.

2003-08-22  Markus Rollmann  <rollmark@uni-koblenz.de>
	* /lib/kerosin
	- fixed various warnings and errors, when compiling kerosin with gcc 

2003-08-22  Markus Rollmann  <rollmark@uni-koblenz.de>
	* /lib/salt/
	- removed ptr.h ptrmanager.h and quadlink.h from Makefile.am
	- added gcc/sharedlibrary.cpp to Makefile.am
	- moved class object declaration for class Leaf from leaf.h to
	class.h to break circular inclusion between leaf.h and class.h
	- removed class_m.h from the repository and Makefile.am
	
2003-08-21  Markus Rollmann  <rollmark@uni-koblenz.de>
	* /lib/salt /lib/zeitgeist
	- added comments and gpl headers to the salt and zeitgeist libraries
	- removed ptr.h, ptrmangager.h and quadlink.h as they were not
	in use

2003-08-07  Markus Rollmann  <rollmark@uni-koblenz.de>
	* added /lib/zeitgeist/telnetserver/
	- added telnetdaemon.cpp, telnetdaemon.h, telnetserver.h,
	telnetserver.cpp, telnetserver_c.h, telnetsession.h and
	telnetsession.cpp

	- The above files provide remote access to the simulator via telnet
	sessions. The files are derived from app/telnetserver/ and are
	integrated into the class concept of the simulator.

	- To use the telnet server add something like
	telnet=new('zeitgeist/TelnetServer', '/usr/telnet'); to a ruby init
	script near you.

	- Known problems: The output of all issued commands still goes to
	stdout and not over the telnet connection. There are some design
	issues preventing a quick fix.

	* lib/zeitgeist/class.h 
	- reinserted class macros from class_m.h

	* lib/zeitgeist/core.cpp /lib/zeitgeist/leaf.h 
	- fixed some includes

	* lib/zeitgeist/zeitgeist.dsp
	- inserted the telnet server to the project file

2003-06-28  Markus Rollmann  <rollmark@uni-koblenz.de>
	* /app/simulator/survival/survival.rb, /app/simulator/survival/survivalcontrolaspect.cpp
	- added a penalty for an agent that dies; it will be catapulted
	randomly in the air, to create a nice effect :)

2003-06-28  Markus Rollmann  <rollmark@uni-koblenz.de>
	* /app/simulator/survival/survival.rb
	- removed survival.rb from CVS. It is copied during the build
	process of plugin/survival to its location. It is therefore a
	generated filed.

	* /plugin/survival/survival.rb, /plugin/survival/survivalcontrolaspect.cpp
	* /plugin/survival/survivalcontrolaspect.h	
	- refactored the init script for the survial demo simulation
	- modified the survival control aspect to support an unlimited
	number of arbitrary named agents. The original version supported
	exactly two agents with fixed names.

2003-06-22  Markus Rollmann  <rollmark@uni-koblenz.de>
	* app/
	- replaced files in app/ directory with the latest version of the
	original author (Marco Kögler)
	- added missing projects to the vc app.dsw workspace and tested
	the projects

2003-06-04  Markus Rollmann  <rollmark@uni-koblenz.de>
	* lib/zeitgeist/zeitgeist.dsp
	added class_m.h to the VC project file

	* lib/keorsin/imageserver/imageserver.h
	replaced #include<leaf.h> in imageserver.h with 
	#include<zeitgeist/class.h>
	
2003-06-03  Oliver Obst  <fruit@robolog.org>

	* lib/zeitgeist/scriptserver/scriptserver.h: 
	added define so that ruby can be included with gnuc

	* lib/zeitgeist/object.cpp: 
	added check for boost version. Needs to be expanded, as get() 
	for shared_ptr disappeared after 1-28-0. 

	* lib/zeitgeist/leaf.h: 
	moved declaration of leaf class factory to class.h

	* lib/zeitgeist/class.h, lib/zeitgeist/class.cpp,
	lib/zeitgeist/class_m.h:
	- moved class macros to class_m.h 
	- checking for hash_map availability
	  (will be replaced by std::map if necessary)

	* lib/zeitgeist/base.cpp: 
	added shared_ptr casts for better compatibility

2003-05-19  Oliver Obst  <fruit@robolog.org>

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, lib/Makefile.am, 
	lib/salt/Makefile.am:
	- added automake support
	
	* lib/salt/vector.h, lib/salt/sharedlibrary.h, 
	lib/salt/matrix.cpp, lib/salt/gmath.h, lib/salt/frustum.cpp, 
	lib/salt/fileclasses.h, lib/salt/fileclasses.cpp, 
	lib/salt/defines.h, lib/salt/bounds.h, lib/salt/bounds.cpp:
	- added copyright text, and, in .h files, the inclusion of the 
	config.h file. 
	- changed standard c headers to c++ headers

	* lib/salt/vc++/sharedlibrary.cpp, lib/salt/gcc/sharedlibrary.cpp,
	lib/salt/salt.h, lib/salt/rect.h, lib/salt/quadlink.h, 
	lib/salt/ptrmanager.h, lib/salt/ptr.h, lib/salt/plane.h,
	lib/salt/plane.cpp, lib/salt/path.h, lib/salt/path.cpp, 
	lib/salt/matrix.h, lib/salt/frustum.h:
	- added copyright text and, in .h files, the inclusion of the
	config.h file. 

	* lib/salt/tvector.h: 
	- added copyright text 
	- using config.h file
	- fixed template method Cross in class TVector3 (at least for 
	gcc 3.2, it was a bug)
	
2003-04-30  Oliver Obst  <fruit@uni-koblenz.de>

	* Moved everything done so far into a separate branch
	(genesis). Added code from Diploma Thesis of Marco Kögler
	<kögler@uni-koblenz.de>, which provides an already running
	and flexible simulator for physical 3D simulations. The initial
	version is running on MS Windows, so one of the tasks is to
	provide Makefiles and changes to compile a Linux version. 

	* In the main branch, removed all ChangeLog entries for the
	"genesis" branch from the ChangeLog so that the old entries do not
	cause confusion here. Code and changes for the genesis branch were
	due to Oliver Obst <fruit@uni-koblenz.de> and
	Tom Howard <tomhoward@users.sourceforge.net>.
