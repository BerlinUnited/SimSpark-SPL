	* ./utility/forwarder/forwarder.h
	* ./utility/forwarder/forwarder.cc	
	Added interface methods to remove streams, get and set priority
	masks in the ForwarderStreamBuf conveniently. 
	A global object Forwarder object smux has been added (to be used

	namespace Utility. 
	
	* ./utility/forwarder/forwarderstreambuf.h 
	* ./utility/forwarder/forwarderstreambuf.cc

	be added twice. The priority mask of a stream will be re-set
	instead.

	stream have been added.
	Minor changes to be compliant with the coding style.
