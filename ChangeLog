	looking for libdl

	* ./utility/console/example.cc

	library dependencies figured out by autoconf, so removed -ldl from
	the Makefile.am
	
	* ./utility/console/consoleinputlinebinding.cc
	* ./utility/console/consoleparser.cc
	* ./utility/console/console.cc
	flushing smux after error messages

2002-08-21  Oliver Obst  <fruit@robolog.org>

	* ./utility/Makefile.am
	added console subdir, as the console compiles now completely

	* ./utility/classserver/classserver.cc
	fixed forgotten renaming of methods
	
	* ./utility/console/
	Added some remaining classes to get the console (almost) working.
	Other file changes due to the coding style changes.
	Some console commands have still to be added; and the example 
	doesn't really work yet.

	* ./utility/forwarder/Makefile.am
	compiling the library and the example using libtool

	* ./utility/classserver/classserver.h
	* ./utility/classserver/classserver.cc
	Fixed some coding style issues and some bugs related to that.

	coding style stuff.

	* ./utility/console/consoleparser.cc	
	* ./utility/console/scanner.h
	* ./utility/console/scanner.cc
	Coding style changes.	

	* ./utility/console/commands/commandserver.h
	* ./utility/console/commands/commandserver.cc
	Added command server; a singleton class that provides a pool
	of console commands.

	* ./utility/console/commands/concommand.h
	* ./utility/console/commands/concommand.cc
	Added an ABC for all console commands.
	
	* ./utility/console/commands/conquit.h

	commands. 

2002-08-16  Oliver Obst  <fruit@robolog.org>

	* ./utility/forwarder/example.cc
	* ./utility/forwarder/Makefile.am
	Added a very short example file to demonstrate Forwarder usage.

	* ./utility/forwarder/forwarder.h
	* ./utility/forwarder/forwarder.cc	
	Added interface methods to remove streams, get and set priority
	masks in the ForwarderStreamBuf conveniently. 
	A global object Forwarder object smux has been added (to be used
	like global ostream objects cout or cerr). smux is global in
	namespace Utility. 
	
	* ./utility/forwarder/forwarderstreambuf.h 
	* ./utility/forwarder/forwarderstreambuf.cc
	The destructor was destroying all the streams the class was
	handling. This behavior has been fixed, so the user is now
	responsible for this (Streams like cout or cerr must not be
	destroyed anyway). 
	The semantics of addStream has been changed so that no stream will
	be added twice. The priority mask of a stream will be re-set
	instead. 
	New methods to remove streams, get and set the priority masks of a
	stream have been added.
	Minor changes to be compliant with the coding style.

	* ./utility/classserver/classserver.h
	* ./utility/classserver/classserver.cc
