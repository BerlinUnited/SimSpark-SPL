	* plugin/soccer/visionperceptor/visionperceptor.cpp: 
	* plugin/soccer/visionperceptor/visionperceptor_c.cpp: 
	added new visionperceptor (using spherical coordinates).
	This stuff works for me, but is is untested.
	The perceptor returns spherical coordinates (dist angle1 angle2),
	the angles are returned in degrees.

	* plugin/soccer/fieldflag/fieldflag.cpp,
	* plugin/soccer/fieldflag/fieldflag.h,
	* plugin/soccer/fieldflag/fieldflag_c.cpp:

	* app/simulator/simulator.rb: 
	queuing up some agents to start initially

	* lib/oxygen/spadesserver/spadesserver_c.cpp: 
	added ruby interface for the QueueAgents method

	* lib/oxygen/spadesserver/spadesserver.h: 
	* lib/oxygen/spadesserver/spadesserver.cpp: 
	- added flag for simulation engine mode changes. The
	  pauseModeCallback checks this flag for changes and sets the
	  simulation engine mode as scheduled.
	- added StartAgents method to start up new agents. Agents can only
	  be started after SPADES called the SpadesServer::initialize
	  method, so init scripts cannot start agents by calling this method
	  directly. Because of this
	- I added the QueueAgents method, that collects the agents to start in a
	  queue. The agent queue will be used in the pause method to call
	  the StartAgents method. QueueAgents can be called from ruby
	  scripts as "queueAgents".

2003-12-25  Oliver Obst  <fruit@robolog.org>

	* lib/oxygen/sceneserver/basenode.h:
	moved private internal update methods to protected section,

	* app/rcssmonitor3d/tcpsocket.cpp, app/rcssmonitor3d/tcpsocket.h,
	* app/rcssmonitor3d/types.h:
	Added initial version of rcssserv3d. This is a simple monitor that
	works together with the MonitorTest class in
	/plugin/monitortest. By default it connects to 127.0.0.1:12001,
	the default spades monitorport for a local server. MonitorTest and
	RcssMonitor3d exchange very simple S-Expressions in the form
	'(player x y z)' that are intepreted as 3 dimensional
	coordinates. The received coordinates are displayed as spheres
	above a grid.

	* app/Makefile.am: 
	added rcssmonitor3d

	* configure.ac: 
	added app/rcssmonitor3d/Makefile

	* plugin/monitortest/monitortest.cpp:
	added additional debug output implemented GetMonitorInfo analogous
	to PerfectVisionPerceptor. GetMonitorInfo collects the position of
	all AgentAspects and create an s-expression (player x y z).

	* plugin/monitortest/monitortest.h:
	removed stub methods, moved implementation to .cpp

	* lib/oxygen/spadesserver/spadesserver.cpp:
	commented out diagnostic output of simToTime() set the monitor
	update interval to 2 simulation time steps

	* lib/oxygen/monitorserver/monitorserver.cpp:
	some formatting change and additional debug output

	* lib/oxygen/agentaspect/createeffector.cpp:
	move the AgentAspect away from the origin (debug aid for the
	monitor)

	* lib/oxygen/gamecontrolserver/gamecontrolserver.cpp:
	using method GetActiveScene to query the SceneServer for the
	currently active scene node. This avoids a hard coded '/usr/scene'

	* lib/oxygen/gamecontrolserver/gamecontrolserver.h:
	added method GetActiveScene

2003-12-21  Markus Rollmann  <rollmark@uni-koblenz.de>

	* plugin/forceeffector/forceeffector.cpp:
	fixed constructor to call BaseClass constructor

	CreateEffector. Removed setup of the dummy sphere agent. This setup
	code now also resides in the CreateEffector

	* app/spadestest/agentdb.list: 
	fixed version tag

	* app/agenttest/main.cpp: 
	added further processing of spades messages

	* lib/oxygen/spadesserver/spadesserver.cpp:

	fixed some return statements and formatting

	* lib/oxygen/sceneserver/transform.h: 
	made destructor virtual

	* lib/oxygen/gamecontrolserver/gamecontrolserver.cpp:
	fixed test in AgentConnect() for an already known agent. The created
	AgentAspect is now also linked to the object hierarchy below
	'/usr/scene'. Additionally AgentAspect::init() is called.  Parse()
	queries the AgentAspect corresponding to the given id, rather than
	using the internal EffectorMap of the GameControlServer.

	* lib/oxygen/gamecontrolserver/gamecontrolserver.h:
	Parse() takes an addition argument id, giving the agent for which
	a message should be parsed. Removed EffectorMap. Every AgentAspect
	is now responsible for its effectors.

	* lib/oxygen/oxygen.h: 
	some #includes fixed

	* lib/oxygen/oxygen.cpp: 
	added registration of CreateEffector
	removed registation of PerfectVisionPerceptor

	* lib/oxygen/agentaspect/agentaspect.cpp, lib/oxygen/agentaspect/agentaspect.h:
	Added method Init. This method is called from the
	GameControlServer immediately after the AgentAspect is
	constructed. It is responsible for setting up the CreateEffector.
	Added method GetEffector. This method is an interface to the map
	of Effectors of the AgentAspect.

	* lib/oxygen/agentaspect/createaction.h:
	Added CreateAction. This Object stores the 'create' request an agent
	can issue using the CreateEffector

	* lib/oxygen/Makefile.am: removed perfectvisionperceptor files
	added createeffector files

	* lib/oxygen/agentaspect/createeffector.cpp, lib/oxygen/agentaspect/createeffector.h, lib/oxygen/agentaspect/createeffector_c.cpp:
	added CreateEffector. This effector is constructed by the AgentAspect. It's
	purpose is to construct sensors, perceptors and geometry that make up an
	agent. After an agent connected to the simulation it uses the 'create'
	effector to request these objects. In it's current for the 'create' command
	does not take any parameters and creates a dummy agent that consists of a
	sphere with a PerfectVisionSensor and a ForceEffector.

	* plugin/perfectvisionperceptor/.cvsignore:
	* plugin/perfectvisionperceptor/Makefile.am:
	* plugin/perfectvisionperceptor/export.cpp:
	* plugin/perfectvisionperceptor/perfectvisionperceptor.cpp:

	* plugin/forceeffector/forceaction.h:
	* plugin/forceeffector/forceeffector.cpp:
	* plugin/forceeffector/forceeffector.h:
	initial version of ForceAction. This class is derived from ActionObject and
	stores the force vector, the ForceEffector should apply.
	implemented ForceEffector::GetActionObject and ForceEffector::Realize.
	GetActionObject constructs an ForceEffector object and Realize applies the
	stored force vector.

	* plugin/forceeffector/Makefile.am:

	* plugin/sexpparser/.cvsignore:
	* plugin/sexpparser/Makefile.am:
	* plugin/sexpparser/export.cpp:
	* plugin/sexpparser/sexpparser.h:
	* plugin/sexpparser/sexpparser_c.cpp:
	Added an initial version of a parser module for s-expressions. For our
	purposes, sexpr have to have an atom at first element of the list. The 
	sexpr given as string to the Parse method are converted into lists of predicates.
	Predicates consist of a name (a string) and a list of boost:any elements. 
	In practice, these elements are either strings or lists containing elements (i.e.
	strings or lists containing elements (i.e. ... you get it)).
	This kind of representation is suitable for our effectors.
	The Generate method of the parser converts lists of elements into an sexpr string.
	Currently, the user of the Generate method has to take care of properly 
	double-quoting strings containing whitespace or single quoting strings that 
	look like s-expressions and so on.

	* utility/sfsexp/sexp_ops.c:
	* utility/sfsexp/sexp_ops.h:
	Added files from the sfsexp library. I've chosen to add the files to the utility
	directory over requiring the user to install it because there is no "make install"
	target in the original sfsexp distribution. Also it would be possible to convert
	the underlying sexp representation into one using proper c++ types.

	- including indexbuffer

	* lib/oxygen/Makefile.am: 
	- added spadesserver subdirectory and files. build spadesserver only if
	the spades library is available.
	

2003-11-15  Oliver Obst  <fruit@robolog.org>

	* lib/zeitgeist/scriptserver/scriptserver.cpp: 
	fixed the script path and removed the STRINGIFY macros as configure 
	properly places quotes around the prefix now.

	* lib/zeitgeist/zeitgeist.rb: 
	- createVariable was taking 3 parameters: 
	namespace, variable name, and a value. kerosin.rb expects a 
	createVariable with 2 parameters, namely
	namespace.variableName, and a value.  createVariable has been
	changed now to accept both forms (ruby doesn't allow for a method
	to have different signatures other than using varargs).
	
2003-11-14  Oliver Obst  <fruit@robolog.org>

	* configure.ac: 
	the PREFIX preprocessor variable was set to NONE
	if no --prefix was given to configure on the command line. In this
	case the autoconf default prefix is used now ($ac_default_prefix).

2003-11-14  Markus Rollmann  <rollmark@uni-koblenz.de>
	- Modified the startup behaviour of the libraries wrt the handling
	of the ruby scripts that are automatically started.

	To each library now belongs exactly one ruby init script with the
	name of the library (e.g. zeitgeist.rb). The init scripts are
	searched at three different locations at startup (in the given
	order):

		- the local 'dot-directory' of the user,
		e.g. '$HOME/.rcssserver3d'. The name of this directory is
		given to the zeitgeist constructor at startup by the
		application (see /app/spadestest/main.cpp for a demo)

		- the PREFIX directory given to the configure script
		(--PREFIX=<directory>). Default value is /usr/share.

		- if an init script isn't found in one of the above
		locations, it is assumed that the libraries along with the
		init scripts were not installed. Therefore for convenience
		the init scripts are searched relative to the /app folder
		in the source tree (e.g. '../../lib/zeitgeist')

		If the local 'dot-directory' wasn't found on startup it
		will be created and the init scripts copied to it. Then on
		the next startup they will be run from the dot-directory.

	The above logic is implemented in ScriptServer::RunInitScript()

2003-11-13  Oliver Obst  <fruit@robolog.org>

	* app/spadestest/main.cpp: removed dependency to kerosin

	* utility/glextgen/Makefile.am:
	* app/zeitgeisttest/Makefile.am:
	* app/coretest/Makefile.am: 
	* app/inputtest/Makefile.am:
	* app/scenetest/Makefile.am: 
	* app/simulator/Makefile.am:
	* app/spadestest/Makefile.am: 
	* plugin/inputsdl/Makefile.am:
	* plugin/soundsystemfmod/Makefile.am:
	* plugin/survival/Makefile.am:
	- changed Makefile.am's so that parts dependend on libkerosin can be 
	  build optionally.
	- removed dependencies to external libraries as these are covered with
	  our simulator libraries.

	* configure.ac:
	- changed the initial file check to use the salt.h header
	- automake 1.7 or better is required
	- defining the preprocessor symbol PREFIX dependent on the configure 
	  prefix value
	- moved all check for graphic libraries (like GL, SDL, DevIL, ...) 
	  into separate macros.
          The basic libraries (libsalt, libzeitgeist, and libkerosin) do not 
	  need them, so they should not depend on them. 
	  The macros have gone to acinclude and are only called in configure.ac.
	  If the libraries are not available on a particular system or if the 
	  user configures with --disable-kerosin, libkerosin and the test 
	  dependend on kerosin will not be build. 
        - moved the check for ODE into a separate macro. Removed dependency on 
	  libode for the base libraries libsalt and libzeitgeist. Applications 
	  need only to link the .la files from our libraries, other dependencies
	  will be resolved automatically by libtool.
        - added the app/fonttest Makefile

	* acinclude.m4:
	- RCSS_PATH_RUBY: added -lruby to RUBY_LDFLAGS
	- RCSS_PATH_FREETYPE: fixed copy/pasty bug; checking only if kerosin 
	  can/should be build
	- added RCSS_KEROSIN_IF_ELSE
	- added RCSS_BUILD_KEROSIN_ERROR
	- added RCSS_BUILD_KEROSIN_INIT
	- added RCSS_BUILD_KEROSIN
	- added RCSS_CHECK_SLANG
	- added RCSS_CHECK_SDL
	- added RCSS_CHECK_DEVIL
	- added RCSS_CHECK_GL
	- added RCSS_CHECK_ODE

	* lib/Makefile.am:
	* lib/kerosin/Makefile.am:
	* lib/oxygen/Makefile.am:
	* lib/salt/Makefile.am:
	* lib/salt/gcc/sharedlibrary.cpp:
	* lib/zeitgeist/Makefile.am:
	- made compiling libkerosin optional
	- moved library dependencies into the makefiles, so that users of our libraries
	  don't need to care about external libraries

2003-11-10  Oliver Obst  <fruit@robolog.org>

	* lib/oxygen/Makefile.am:
	* lib/oxygen/kerosin.cpp:
	* lib/oxygen/kerosin.h:
	* lib/oxygen/sceneserver/sphere.cpp:
	* lib/oxygen/sceneserver/sphere.h:
	added sphere class
	
	* lib/oxygen/oxygen.cpp: 
	registering all the oxygen class object classes

	* plugin/soundsystemfmod/Makefile.am: 
	The soundsystemfmod module is built (only) if configure detected the 
	fmod header and library. The fmod library has to be installed as described 
	in the ./doc/used_libraries.txt file.
	
	* plugin/soundsystemfmod/soundeffectfmod.cpp:
	- interface changed in FSOUND_Sample_Load function for FMOD 3.7

	* plugin/soundsystemfmod/soundmodulefmod.cpp: 
	- the FMUSIC_LoadSongMemory in FMOD function does not exist
	  anymore. Instead, we're using FMUSIC_LoadSongEx now.
	
	* plugin/soundsystemfmod/soundstreamfmod.cpp: 
	- changes so that the file compiles with FMOD 3.7. Some of the "Load" 
	  functions in FMOD have been changed, so that this changes was 
	  required in order to be up to date.

	* configure.ac: 
	added check if the soundsystemfmod plugin should be built

	* acinclude.m4: added a macro for a FMOD check

	* lib/oxygen/.cvsignore: 
	* lib/oxygen/Makefile.am:
	* lib/oxygen/oxygen.cpp:
	* lib/oxygen/oxygen.h:
	added oxygen class to register servers
	
	* app/coretest/coretest.rb: removed "bundle" from the module names

2003-11-09  Oliver Obst  <fruit@robolog.org>

	* configure.ac: 
	- switched off static libraries and switched on shared libs so that plugins are properly build 
	- added check for strupr (used by one of the plugins)
	
	* plugin/Makefile.am: 
	* plugin/filesystemrar/Makefile.am: 
	* plugin/filesystemstd/Makefile.am:

	* plugin/soundsystembass/soundsystembass.h:
	* plugin/soundsystemfmod/Makefile.am:
	* plugin/soundsystemfmod/soundsystemfmod.h: 
	* plugin/survival/Makefile.am:
	Compiling the plugins as modules (files to be dlopened by the 
	simulator). The modules will be installed below 
	$(exec_prefix)/lib/rcssserver3D/ .  The package has to be
	compiled using shared libraries to get this working. To be fully
	portable, the simulator should not open the .so files directly but
	rather use the .la files created by libtool to find the proper
	library (see libtool manual).  
	However, for linux opening the .so files should be OK.
	
	To run the simulator, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
	should contain the directory where the plugins can be found.

	* configure.ac: 
	- added workaround for bug in AC_FUNC_MEMCMP macro
	- added check for _vsnprintf (as used by libIL)

	* app/simulator/Makefile.am: using auxiliary library liblibobj for
	system functions that may not be present

2003-11-08  Oliver Obst  <fruit@robolog.org>

	* utility/libobj/Makefile.am: 
	* utility/libobj/.cvsignore:
	* utility/libobj/_vsnprintf.c:
	* utility/libobj/libobj.c:
	* utility/libobj/memcmp.c:
	added a library that contains needed system functions 
	that are not provided by the actual system.

2003-09-26  Oliver Obst  <fruit@robolog.org>

	* acinclude.m4: changed ruby check to look at the right places
	(seems not to work for ruby 1.8.0, though)

	* lib/zeitgeist/scriptserver/scriptserver.h:
	including ruby.h instead of ruby/ruby.h

	* lib/kerosin/imageserver/image.h: 
	including IL/il.h instead of il/il.h

2003-09-05  Oliver Obst  <fruit@robolog.org>

	* lib/zeitgeist/core.cpp: 
	- removed telnetserver for now (seems to be windows 
	   specific code inside)

	* lib/zeitgeist/Makefile.am: 
	- added fileserver stuff

	* lib/oxygen/oxygen.h: 
	- added oxygen.h file to include all the oxygen headers at once

	* configure.ac: 
	- moved check for freetype stuff into a Macro in acinclude.m4 
	- added check for SDL 
	- added check for ruby (a macro in acinclude.m4)

	* acinclude.m4: added some autoconf macros: 
	- RCSS_PATH_RUBY for checking the ruby configuration 
	- RCSS_PATH_FREETYPE for checking the freetype2 configuration

2003-09-03  Oliver Obst  <fruit@robolog.org>

	* lib/kerosin/:
	updated kerosin library: changes for the files that have been 
	going to the oxygen library.

2003-09-02  Oliver Obst  <fruit@robolog.org>

	* plugin/survival/Makefile.am: Added freetype include flag

	* utility/glextgen/glextgen.rb.in: 
	- reading command line parameter as namespace to be used (optional)

	* utility/glextgen/Makefile.am:
	- calling the glextgen ruby script with namespace parameter 'kerosin'
	- added more dependencies
	
	* utility/glextgen/script/glbackend.rb: 
	- backend can optionally insert a namespace into the generated 
	files so that all the methods live in it

2003-09-01  Oliver Obst  <fruit@robolog.org>

	* utility/glextgen/script/glfrontend.rb: 
	- added a filter to the scan method to filter out some misleading lines
	  (some comments containing the ' gl' substring were translated 
	   to functions)

2003-08-31  Oliver Obst  <fruit@robolog.org>

	* lib/oxygen/
	- moved all classes to namespace oxygen

	* lib/oxygen/Makefile.am:

	- added Makefiles below plugin/

2003-08-31  Markus Rollmann  <rollmark@uni-koblenz.de>
	* lib/oxygen/physicsserver
	- added copyleft and comments
	- added support for box and capped cylinder ODE geoms

	* lib/oxygen/sceneserver
	- added copyleft and coments

2003-08-30  Oliver Obst  <fruit@robolog.org>

	* lib/zeitgeist/Makefile.am: 
	- build a release version or a debug version of the library 
	  dependent on the switch used during configure time 
	- install the library headers 
	  below $(includedir)/rcssserver3d/zeitgeist

	* lib/salt/Makefile.am: 
	- install the library headers below $(includedir)/rcssserver3d/salt

	* lib/oxygen/Makefile.am: 
	- build a release version or a debug version of the library 
	  dependent on the switch used during configure time 
	- install the library headers below $(includedir)/rcssserver3d/oxygen

	* lib/kerosin/Makefile.am: 
	- build a release version or a debug version of the library 
	  dependent on the switch used during configure time 
	- install the library headers below $(includedir)/rcssserver3d/kerosin

	* configure.ac: - enable debug build by default

2003-08-30  Markus Rollmann  <rollmark@uni-koblenz.de>
	* ./lib/oxygen/physicsserver/
	- added copyleft and some comments

2003-08-29  Oliver Obst  <fruit@robolog.org>

	* lib/oxygen/Makefile.am: 
	- removed 'camera' from sceneserver in the Makefile.am because it 
	  needs OpenGL 
	- removed 'indexbuffer' from sceneserver in the Makefile.am because it 
	  needs OpenGL 
	- removed posbody.h from physicsserver because it was empty anyway

	* lib/oxygen/sceneserver/fpscontroller.cpp: changed a float
	pointer to an ODE dReal pointer to make gcc compile it

	* lib/oxygen/sceneserver/basenode.cpp: 
	- basenode has been including the openglserver. liboxygen should be 
	independent of OpenGL, so this has been commented out.  
	- methods ::Render() and ::RenderAmbient() do some GL stuff. 
	These parts have been commented out to make everything compile.

	* lib/oxygen/physicsserver/body.cpp: 
	changed two float pointers to ODE dReal pointers to make gcc compile it

2003-08-28  Markus Rollmann  <rollmark@uni-koblenz.de>
	* ./lib/kerosin/agentaspect/perceptor_c.cpp
	* ./lib/kerosin/openglserver/glextensionreg.cpp
	* ./lib/kerosin/renderserver/renderserver.cpp
	* ./lib/kerosin/sceneserver/transform.cpp
	* ./lib/kerosin/sceneserver/transform_c.cpp
	* ./lib/kerosin/textureserver/texture2d.cpp
	* ./lib/kerosin/textureserver/texture2d.h
	* ./lib/kerosin/textureserver/textureserver.cpp
	- compile fixes

	* ./lib/kerosin/renderserver/renderserver.cpp
	* ./lib/kerosin/sceneserver/light.cpp
	* ./lib/kerosin/sceneserver/light.h
	* ./lib/kerosin/sceneserver/staticmesh.cpp
	* ./lib/kerosin/sceneserver/staticmesh.h
	- commented out methods related to fancy lighting to remove
	dependency to libopcode. Renderserver will always take the general
	lighting path for now.

	* ./lib/kerosin/textureserver/textureserver.h
	* ./lib/kerosin/openglserver/openglserver.h
	* ./lib/kerosin/materialserver/materialserver.h
	* ./lib/kerosin/agentaspect/perceptor.h
	* ./lib/kerosin/soundserver/soundserver.h
	* ./lib/kerosin/inputserver/inputserver.h
	- fixed use of hash_map vs map
	
	* ./utility/glextgen/tocopy/cpp_begin.txt
	- added missing explicit (void*) cast for gcc version

2003-08-29  Oliver Obst  <fruit@robolog.org>

	* lib/salt/salt.h: Added links on the main page generated by
	doxygen to the existing information for developers.

	* doc/Makefile.am: 
	Updated Makefile.am so that building the doxygen doc is done by
	the 'all' target. The existing developers documentation is copied
	into a subdirectory of the generated html directory so that the
	generated main page can link to it.

	* lib/kerosin/Makefile.am: Changed the Makefile.am so that the
	openglserver in kerosin depends upon the built sources from the
	glextgen script. The built sources were removed from the CVS and
	will be copied from the utility/glextgen/ directory on compile
	time before anything else is done for kerosin. Additionally, the
	derived sources were taken out from the dist target.

	* utility/glextgen/glextgen.in:
	Added a top level glextgen ruby script template from which 
	configure can create an instance of the script which fits to the 
	actual system.

	* lib/kerosin/textureserver/textureserver.h,
 	  lib/kerosin/openglserver/openglserver.h,
	  lib/kerosin/agentaspect/perceptor.h,
	  lib/kerosin/agentaspect/agentaspect.h: 
	- added copyleft 
	- using config.h
	- replaced #ifdef HAVE_HASH_MAP by #if HAVE_HASH_MAP	

2003-08-28  Oliver Obst  <fruit@robolog.org>

	* lib/zeitgeist/leaf.cpp, lib/zeitgeist/object.cpp: 
	- got rid of using the obsolete get() method from boost::weak_ptr<> 
	by using an additional boost::shared_ptr<> similar to the way used 
	for the Class class.

	* lib/zeitgeist/class.cpp: 
	- fixed use of boost::weak_ptr<>.get(), which was removed from the
        weak_ptr interface in recent versions of boost. The problem was
	fixed by assigning a shared_ptr for the get() operation.	
	- fixed use of deleting a boost::weak_ptr<> from a std::list. The
	problem here is that std::list<>.remove() was used, which needs an
	operator ==. (weak_ptr<> do not provide the == operator anymore). 
	The problem was fixed by using std::list<>.erase() for each element 
	that points to the same Object.

	* lib/zeitgeist/class.h: 
	fixed use of hash_map vs map: class uses a hash_map if found by 
	configure, otherwise the std::map is used for this. class.h has to 
	include the config.h file (like all the other classes also should do)

2003-08-26  Oliver Obst  <fruit@uni-koblenz.de>

	* lib/kerosin/renderserver/renderserver.h,
          lib/kerosin/renderserver/renderserver.cpp:
	added a render server responsible for the actual rendering of a
	scene. (stuff coming from sceneserver)

	* lib/kerosin/sceneserver/sceneserver.h,
	  lib/kerosin/sceneserver/sceneserver.cpp:
	moved OpenGL specific stuff to a new class 'renderserver' so that
	a pure simulator can be build without using any opengl.

2003-08-22  Markus Rollmann  <rollmark@uni-koblenz.de>
	* /lib/kerosin
	- fixed various warnings and errors, when compiling kerosin with gcc 

2003-08-22  Markus Rollmann  <rollmark@uni-koblenz.de>
	* /lib/salt/
	- removed ptr.h ptrmanager.h and quadlink.h from Makefile.am
	- added gcc/sharedlibrary.cpp to Makefile.am
	- moved class object declaration for class Leaf from leaf.h to
	class.h to break circular inclusion between leaf.h and class.h
	- removed class_m.h from the repository and Makefile.am
	
2003-08-21  Markus Rollmann  <rollmark@uni-koblenz.de>
	* /lib/salt /lib/zeitgeist
	- added comments and gpl headers to the salt and zeitgeist libraries
	- removed ptr.h, ptrmangager.h and quadlink.h as they were not
	in use

2003-08-07  Markus Rollmann  <rollmark@uni-koblenz.de>
	* added /lib/zeitgeist/telnetserver/
	- added telnetdaemon.cpp, telnetdaemon.h, telnetserver.h,
	telnetserver.cpp, telnetserver_c.h, telnetsession.h and
	telnetsession.cpp

	- The above files provide remote access to the simulator via telnet
	sessions. The files are derived from app/telnetserver/ and are
	integrated into the class concept of the simulator.

	- To use the telnet server add something like
	telnet=new('zeitgeist/TelnetServer', '/usr/telnet'); to a ruby init
	script near you.

	- Known problems: The output of all issued commands still goes to
	stdout and not over the telnet connection. There are some design
	issues preventing a quick fix.

	* lib/zeitgeist/class.h 
	- reinserted class macros from class_m.h

	* lib/zeitgeist/core.cpp /lib/zeitgeist/leaf.h 
	- fixed some includes

	* lib/zeitgeist/zeitgeist.dsp
	- inserted the telnet server to the project file

2003-06-28  Markus Rollmann  <rollmark@uni-koblenz.de>
	* /app/simulator/survival/survival.rb, /app/simulator/survival/survivalcontrolaspect.cpp
	- added a penalty for an agent that dies; it will be catapulted
	randomly in the air, to create a nice effect :)

	* /app/simulator/survival/survival.rb
	- removed survival.rb from CVS. It is copied during the build
	process of plugin/survival to its location. It is therefore a
	generated filed.

	* /plugin/survival/survival.rb, /plugin/survival/survivalcontrolaspect.cpp
	* /plugin/survival/survivalcontrolaspect.h	
	- refactored the init script for the survial demo simulation
	- modified the survival control aspect to support an unlimited
	number of arbitrary named agents. The original version supported
	exactly two agents with fixed names.

	* app/
	- replaced files in app/ directory with the latest version of the
	original author (Marco Kgler)
	- added missing projects to the vc app.dsw workspace and tested
	the projects

2003-06-04  Markus Rollmann  <rollmark@uni-koblenz.de>
	* lib/zeitgeist/zeitgeist.dsp
	added class_m.h to the VC project file

	* lib/keorsin/imageserver/imageserver.h
	replaced #include<leaf.h> in imageserver.h with 
	#include<zeitgeist/class.h>

	* lib/zeitgeist/scriptserver/scriptserver.h: 
	added define so that ruby can be included with gnuc

	* lib/zeitgeist/object.cpp: 
	added check for boost version. Needs to be expanded, as get() 
	for shared_ptr disappeared after 1-28-0. 

	* lib/zeitgeist/leaf.h: 
	moved declaration of leaf class factory to class.h

	* lib/zeitgeist/class.h, lib/zeitgeist/class.cpp,
	lib/zeitgeist/class_m.h:
	- moved class macros to class_m.h 
	- checking for hash_map availability
	  (will be replaced by std::map if necessary)

	* lib/zeitgeist/base.cpp: 
	added shared_ptr casts for better compatibility

2003-05-19  Oliver Obst  <fruit@robolog.org>

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, lib/Makefile.am, 
	lib/salt/Makefile.am:
	- added automake support
	
	* lib/salt/vector.h, lib/salt/sharedlibrary.h, 
	lib/salt/matrix.cpp, lib/salt/gmath.h, lib/salt/frustum.cpp, 
	lib/salt/fileclasses.h, lib/salt/fileclasses.cpp, 
	lib/salt/defines.h, lib/salt/bounds.h, lib/salt/bounds.cpp:
	- added copyright text, and, in .h files, the inclusion of the 
	config.h file.

	lib/salt/matrix.h, lib/salt/frustum.h:
	- added copyright text and, in .h files, the inclusion of the
	config.h file. 

	* lib/salt/tvector.h: 
	- added copyright text 
	- using config.h file

	gcc 3.2, it was a bug)
	
2003-04-30  Oliver Obst  <fruit@uni-koblenz.de>

	* Moved everything done so far into a separate branch
	(genesis). Added code from Diploma Thesis of Marco Kgler
	<kgler@uni-koblenz.de>, which provides an already running
	and flexible simulator for physical 3D simulations. The initial
	version is running on MS Windows, so one of the tasks is to
	provide Makefiles and changes to compile a Linux version. 

	* In the main branch, removed all ChangeLog entries for the
	"genesis" branch from the ChangeLog so that the old entries do not
	cause confusion here. Code and changes for the genesis branch were
	due to Oliver Obst <fruit@uni-koblenz.de> and
	Tom Howard <tomhoward@users.sourceforge.net>.
