[0.2.1]
This release of simspark is prepared for RoboCup 2010 competitions in Singapore.
In this release you can find some bug and compilation fixes, improved Windows
support and some new features such as the potential of using different 
physical simulation engines.

* New features:
 - The core physics system does no longer depend on ODE (Thanks to Andreas). 
 ODE implementation is now provided as a plugin.
   
* Fixes:
 - Compilation fixes on newer compilers (VS 2010)
 - Fixed some bugs on 64 bit systems and in multi-threaded mode. It is (hopefully)
   possible to run multi-threaded games while logging is enabled

[0.2]
In this release you can find some bug and compilation fixes, improved Windows
support and some new features including a new sensor and features to facilitate
agent debugging and development. It also provides a more deterministic behavior 
for agents which should make them more reliable.

* New features:
 - An Accelerometer sensor which reports the linear acceleration
 - A "Sync Mode" operation is introduced. In this mode, the server will not
   advance to the next cycle until all connected agents send a "(syn)" command
   to the server. You can use this mode by setting "agentSyncMode" to true in
   simspark.rb (or spark.rb)
 - Simulator will run in simulation time mode instead of real time
   if "useRealTime" variable is set to false in simspark.rb (or spark.rb)
   
* More deterministic agent-server communication
 - Simspark will now collect received commands right before sending
   sense data of the last cycle. So, any commands which is sent by agents
   after receiving new sense data will be executed in the next cycle, not the 
   current one. This results in a more deterministic behavior, and agents' 
   efficiency should not change between remote and local runs considerably.

* More convenience:
 - Simspark should always accept connections. No more "Connection refused"
   messages and the need to wait for simspark's network port to be freed!
 - To make changes to most of the resource files (e.g. simspark.rb), you can
   create a copy in ~/.simspark directory and make desired changes there. The 
   directory structure of the original files should be preserved (e.g.
   rsg/agent/nao/nao.rgs)

* Fixes:
 - Compilation fixes
 - Fixed some rendering bugs (agents not visible through goals)

[0.1.2]
This release brings some bugfixes, better performance and also better Windows
support. A Windows installer will be available too. This is the first version 
which runs in multi-threaded mode by default. The multi-threaded mode is still
in early stages, and it can be improved cosiderably in future.

Main changes of this release are:
 - improved Windows support, including Windows Installer. 
 - Multi-threaded mode now works, and is the default mode when running simspark
 - Performance improvements
 - Fixed a bug in networking code, which were introduced in 0.1.1

[0.1.1]
This release is mainly a bug-fix release, and is the last release before
RoboCup 2009 competitions. It is not much different from version 0.1.
Main changes are:
 - improved MacOSX and Windows support
 - compilation fixes for latest library versions
 - more reliable and a bit more fair network communication with the agents

[0.1]
This is the first release of the simulator after RoboCup 2008 competitions,
and the first release of simspark core simulation package as a separate
package.
In this release, MaxStepsPerCycle have been reduced to 1, so the simulation
time spent in each cycle is fixed. As a result, the performance of the agents
should not depend on the simulator speed, and they should be able to sense/act
in fixed simulation time steps.
This package provides a generic simulation framework and does not contain any
soccer features. To use the soccer simulator, you should install rcssserver3d
package which depends on this package. 
Also, we do not use autotools for our build system anymore. You should use
CMake (version 2.6) to build the package. See INSTALL for further installation
instructions.
