RELEASE News of simspark-0.2.3

Finally, a new release of simspark has come! The most exciting feature of this
release is probably the multi-threaded agent control (thanks to Andreas from
RoboCanes for the initial patch). Previously, this part of the code was 
sequential even in multi-threaded mode, but now it can manage several agnets in
parallel which should (hopefully!) increase performance. Besides, there are 
a number of compilation and bug fixes here and there and also better Windows
support. Small enhancements are also available. You can find more details below:

- Multi-threaded Agent Control
 -- AgentControl multi-threaded implementation added and enabled by default.
    It can be disabled using $threadedAgentControl variable inside spark.rb.
- OpenGL System can now request the end of simulation (makes it possible to
  close spark monitor's window to quit!
- The location of init scripts (e.g. zeitgeist.rb) can now be specified using
  --init-script-prefix (you still can put most of the scripts and data files
  like rsg/ directory inside your ~/.simspark/ instead).
- Compilation fixes
- Support more recent Ruby versions
- Windows Compilation fixes, and few enhancements for better Windows support
- Support for building Windows binary in GNU/Linux using Mingw32
 -- Notice: Windows related changes were already used in 0.2.2 simspark
    installer
- Several bug fixes     

Thanks to Yuan Xu and Sander van Dijk for their contributions in this release.
