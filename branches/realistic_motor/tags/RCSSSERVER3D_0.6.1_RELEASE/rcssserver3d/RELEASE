RELEASE News of rcssserver3d-0.6.1

This is the first release of the simulator after RoboCup 2008 competitions,
and the first release of rcssserver3d package as a separate package which 
uses simspark package to implement a hunamoid soccer simulation environment.
In this version of the simulator, restricted vision perceptor is enabled again,
and is going to be used in 2009 competitions. You can read more about this
perceptor in 0.5.9 NEWS section.
Finally, we do not use autotools for our build system anymore. You should use
CMake (version 2.6) to build the package. See INSTALL for further installation
instructions.

* Restricted Vision: 
  - restricted vision perceptor is installed on Nao.

* New requirements for building the pacakge:
  - You'll need CMake 2.6 to configure and build the package
