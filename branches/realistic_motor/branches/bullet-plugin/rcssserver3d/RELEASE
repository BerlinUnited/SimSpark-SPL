RELEASE News of rcssserver3d-0.6.4

This release is supposed to be the final version of rcssserver3d for
RoboCup 2010 in Singapore. The release includes a referee patch contributed
by FCPortugal team which enforces some rules to avoid crowding of many players
in a small area and to penalize ill-behaved players. Additionally, this 
release comes with some more facilities for a human referee to control the game
and individual players in the field.

* New keys in rcssmonitor3d:
- n: Cycle through agents. A red marker disc shows which agent is currently
  selected
- e: Clear selection
- lctrl+s: Go into specific-agent-selection-mode. A specific agent can now be
  selected by pressing l or r and then a number. So the sequence 'lctrl+s, l, 4'
  selects the agent with uniform number 4 of the left team
- m: Move selected agent FreeKickDist meters back
- x: Kill selected agent

* Other changes:
- Improved referee to enforce more fair games
- Visual Studio 2010 compilation fixes
- Agents can sense field lines if enabled (currently disabled)
