/*!
 \brief Class for running a Simulation in the SimulationManager.

 <b>General:</b>\n
 A SimulationSetup in the SimulationManager list or loaded from a file can be used to initialize a Simulation.
 The Simulation contains a definition of the SimulationSetup, a filename to save the Simulation to, and the current
 SimulationTasks (threads and processes) as defined in the SimulationSetup.
 There is always at most one Simulation initialized.
 Running tasks are stopped before the Simulation is closed and a Simulation has to be closed before initializing a new one.\n

 <b>Saving:</b>\n
 Simulation save files are basically a changed version of the initial SimulationSetup (containing the state after all the
 changes made after initialization). The difference is, that they contain a reference to a data file. Before closing all
 gui plugins of the setup are nofitied to save session data to the data object and when starting a new Simulation with this
 SimulationSetup save file the data file is loaded and handed to the plugins so they can recover their previous state.\n

 <b>Setup:</b>\n
 When initializing the Simulation with a SimulationSetup, the setup is deep-copied. This means, even though the setup in the current
 Simulation might have the same name and data as a SimulationSetup in the SimulationManagers preset setup list, they are different objects
 and contain different shared pointers to PluginDefinitions and TaskDefinitions. Changing the setup of the current Simulation will not
 affect the preset SimulationSetups. adter initializing a SimulationTask, it contain a shared pointer to the TaskDefinition in the
 initialized SimulationSetup. Changing the TaskDefinition of a SimulationTask will change the SimulationSetup of the current simulation.\n

 <b>Execution:</b>\n
 The SimulationManager only creates one single Simulation at the start.
 New Simulations are initialized by loading a new SimulationSetup in this Simulation.
 This way, plugins do not have to reconnect to the Simulations signals.
 Various signals of the Simulation like aboutToBeStopped(), running(), paused() etc. inform about the state of the Simulation.\n

 The Simulation can be initialized, run (if initialized or stopped), stopped (if running or paused), or paused (if running).
 Any of these calls to the Simulation does the same with all the contained SimulationTasks, unless specified otherwise.
 It is possible to start the Simulation without starting the tasks, and it is possible to start, pause or stop a SimulationTasks one
 at a time. However, there are two restrictions:\n
 1) Tasks can only be running (or paused), when the Simulation is running (or paused). Running a task will start the Simulation.
 Stopping the Simulation will stop all the tasks.\n
 2) Because of limitations of the SimSpark simulation engine, there has to be a single one server. Freely stopping it when there are
 dependant tasks will cause a crash. Therefore, when using a SimulationServer, its execution state is linked to the Simulation.
 Stopping the server will stop the Simulation. Starting the Simulation will always start the server.
 See SimSpark documentation for further information.\n
