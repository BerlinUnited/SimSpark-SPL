 \brief QObject derived class used to initialize, run and control SimSpark.

 The SparkController emits signals informing about the state of SimSpark and is the main interface for Plugins to interact with SimSpark in a managed way.

 After starting SimSpark, the controller is a management system to access SimSpark externally.
 The following elements are all either a part of, or are registered to the SparkController:\n
 - Gui SimulationControlNode to be notified about SimSpark Simulation events (see ISimControl and GuiSimControl)\n
 - Command queues to interact with SimSpark (see AbstractCommandQueue and SparkCommand::CommandQueue\n
 - Render context initialization (see sparkcontroller.cpp)\n
 - Script value initialization (see sparkcontroller.cpp)\n
 - Log initialization (see sparkcontroller.cpp)\n
