/*!
 \brief Abstract class for a single task (thread or process) in a Simulation.

 SimulationTask is the base class for all threads and processes managed by the SimulationManager and contained in a Simulation.
 They are defined by a TaskDefinition and stored in a SimulationSetup.
 The concrete classes are either QThreads or QProcesses. Therefore the SimulationTask is not derived from QObject but uses a messager
 object of SimulationTaskMessager to receive and send messages.

 The SimulationTask is executed using runTask().
 Depending on its derived class this either executes run() in new Thread or uses run() to start a new Process.\n

 The SimulationTask keeps track of its actual state. It receives update calls from the threads and processes and notfies the
 SimulationManager if something changed.
 Since the SimulationTasks run() methods may all run in different threads, and thus notify any change via queued signals, the state is not
 always perfectly synced with the real state of the task. Therefore all the other gui elements and plugins should access the state the state
 via the SimulationManager or by requesting the ETaskExecutionState instead of asking the derived classes for their state.

 The possible states of a SimulationTask are defined in ETaskExecutionState.
