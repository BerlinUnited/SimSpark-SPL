   {
       GUI_FRAME()

/**
  \brief Second Macro for new in-application attachable frame plugin initialization. To be used in the cpp file.

   \warning This macro registers an attachable frame plugin that is defined in the main application itself! 
   To register a plugin that should be exported from a shared library, use REGISTER_EXPORT_FRAME instead.

   Registers the AttachableFrame in the PluginFactory and receives a new class id.\n
   CLASS: Name of the Class.\n
   NAME: Default Name of all Frames of this type. They may be renamed upon initialization
           (depending on the PluginDefinition file).\n
   CAPTION: Default caption of the Class. Can be changed by the user for every instance.\n
   AMOUNT: Maximum amount of instances for this plugin. Default is 1.\n

   It is strongly encouraged to always choose a class name in lower case ending with "frame" so there wont be any namespace issues
   with other plugins and the user is always able to identify the class name easily.
   When choosing an amount of maximum instances bigger than 1, be sure to alsways handle multiple instantiation.
   Providing Settings or menu objects might have to be handled in two categories, static and non-static entries.
   To check which instance is currently executed, use getInstanceIndex().

   Example:
   \code
   //DerivedFrame.cpp
   #include "DerivedFrame.h"

   REGISTER_FRAME(DerivedFrame, "myderivedframe", "MyDerived", 1)
   \endcode

   \todo The plugin registration uses some kind of dirty trick. The registration is done when including the cpp file,
   by using the initialization of unused variable mPluginInitialized to call the registration function. As long as REGISTER_FRAME is called
   once and only once (and with a unique name for each registered frame) this works just fine and the usage is really simple, since
   only the own .h and .cpp files have to be edited.
   To be more fail safe it would be good to add a template initialization function automatically calling the registration for each
   class that is attempted to be instantiated by the factory (Abstract Factory Pattern with template). This could eliminate the need to use the
   second macro and would only register it if it is actually included somewhere.

/*!
 \brief Base Plugin class for Frame-Widgets that can be attached to Attachmentpoints.

 <b>General:</b>\n
 AttachableFrames work like any other plugin, except for being able to utilize a visual representation.
 They can create Menus, MenuActions, Toolboxes and ToolboxActions and provide them not only globally, but locally too,
 thus providing the GUI with control options for the frame.
 They may also provide Settings Widgets for the SettingsDialog or communicate with other plugins. 
 Derived Frames may be of one of the in EFrameType defined types.\n

 <b>Attaching AttachableFrames:</b>\n
 The attachment points for AttachableFrames are specified in the SimulationSetup loaded by the SimulationManager.\n

 <b>Communication:</b>\n
 AttachableFrames are usually connected to the MainWindow managed by the main thread.
 Therefore all their functions should be executed in the main thread if they can cause changes in any gui property managed by the main thread.
 If you wish to offer functions callable by another thread you usually have to send these commands to the thread in which the plugin is executed
 (the main thread).
 The CommunicationManager offers tools for SignalPlugins and AttachableFrames to communicate with each other even if running in different threads.\n

 <b>Execution:</b>\n
 /warning Although any plugin can be specified to be able to be executed in another Thread (by setting its execution type),
 AttachableFrame plugins should usually never have the need of being executed manually since they can receive direct user interaction.
 Their execution type is ET_NEVER, which means they cant be run in another thread and cant be executed in another thread by default.
 If however you wish to enable execution of the virtual run(), pause(), stop() and reset() functions, you can enable it using setExecutionType().
 In this case make sure not to call any functions that emit non-queued signals and never call functions or emit signals which result in the
 (non-main-)thread changing any Gui-Object properties.
 When another thread except for the main thread changes the gui layout this will most likely result in a crash (or sometimes in a deadlock).
