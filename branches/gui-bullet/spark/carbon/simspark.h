/*!
 \brief Spark derived class. Contains the Spark Core and handles initialization and basic controls.

 <b>General:</b>\n
 This class is the heart of the Simulation, the only class derived from Spark and - together with SparkController - representing the interface to the Spark
 library and its simulation environment.\n

 <b>Definition and creation:</b>\n
 SimSpark is started by a ServerThread, which is a SimulationTask defined by a TaskDefinition in a SimulationSetup.
 The definition for properties of the spark execution can be done using any of the plugins and modification options the Gui offers.
 See SimulationFrame and SetupFrame for two plugins that allow creating new SimulationSetups or changing the setup in the current Simulation.\n

The initialization and execution properties of SimSpark consist of:\n
Main Script: The script initializing the Simulation (e.g. "rcssserver3d.rb"). Will be executed the first time the simulation is executed.\n
Secondary Script: The script initializing the Spark core (e.g. "spark.rb"). The other initialization scripts (oxygen.rb, salt.rb, etc.) are expected 
to be in the same directory. Will be executed once at time of initialization. Usually contains the base set of functions that can be used in other scripts.\n
Additional Scripts: A list of additional scripts to execute every time the Simulation is started. Executed after the main script and before calling run().\n


 <b>Script files:</b>\n
 SimSpark uses ruby scripts to initialize the core, setup the simulation and access it during runtime.
 The secondary script (e.g. "spark.rb") usually initializes the core and specifies macro functions for other scripts to use.
 The main script initializes the simulation and sets up the content of the zeitgeist tree.
 The additional scripts are meant to provide a fast and easy way to change the Simulation properties without the need of bein able to understand
 Ruby or the spark script interface.
 With a rich variety of elementary scripts the setup of a Simulation can be altered to essentially form new Simulation in the scope of the implemented
 and accessible functionality.

 For example, the "rcssserver3d.rb" script file starts a server, defines a camera, starts the soccer simulation and possibly adds an internal monitor.
 By writing different kinds of elementary scripts that each accomplish only one of these things, a list of additional scripts can alter the initial
 setup of the Simulation.
 To make sure that there are no dangerously illegal calls, the elementary scripts should check and asset a correct order.
 This means for example, that any script that modifies the initialization of the soccer simulation should check if the required dynamic libraries
 for the soccer simulation have already been loaded.

 Usually the script-solution as opposed to a solution who uses compiled code is meant to be as flexible as possible.
 However, this also leaves the user with the full responsibility of understanding the underlying functionality.
 A middle-level in form of easily combineable script-blocks each modifying the simulation in an understandable way makes the program powerful and flexible
 as well as more easily controllable, understandable and more robust at the same time.

 <b>Using an own SimSpark Monitor:</b>\n
 Most of the rendering functions, texture initialization and other OpenGL commands used by Spark and its plugins wont call glMakeCurrent() to make
 the created rendering context current in the simulation server thread.
 Therefore its easy to render the scene graph managed in the simulation server thread in another thread, e.g. with a GlWidget in the gui main thread.
 For this to succeed the renderer has to offer the OpenGl-Context to the SparkController using the OpenGlManager, so the server can initialize
 textures and so on in the correct context.
 In the case of there being an external renderer, the SparkController will set the script variable $gui_enableExternalRendering and disable rendering
 of custom render nodes.\n

 \todo <b>Using an own SimSpark Monitor:</b>\n
 Rendering the scene graph externallyonly works if there are no plugins in SimSpark that depend on owning the rendering context, like for
 example vision perceptors for robots that have to render the scene themselves.
 To change this, either implement a plugin in Spark that can manage switching the OpenGl-context (which might be costly due to additional thread barriers),
 or write a rendering plugin in Spark which renders the whole scene into a texture which than can be copied or offered to a different rendering context
 in the Gui. This way, a renderer in the gui would just have to display this texture instead of rendering everything itself and the rendering control
 remains within SimSpark.\n

 \todo <b>Problems with SimSpark:</b>\n
 SimSpark was initially not meant to be started more than once. It is not possible to create more than one instance of a zeitgeist::Core, because there are
 several static references in the code.
 It is also no possible to gracefully shutdown the single zeitgeist::Core completely so it could be cleanly reinitialized.
 Therefore it is currently neither possible to instantiate more than one SparkSimulationThread in one Simulation, nor can two Simulations in one sesssion
 use a different core initialization Script.\n
 Currently the SimulationManager stores the first ServerThread that is created and prevents it from being deleted.
 If the Simulation is stopped, SimSpark sadly cant be stopped completely using SimulationServer::Quit(), but it is paused and tried to be resetted.
 Even if this might work for Simulations who only differ in simple initialization skripts, it is a major drawback for the flexibility of a general
 simulation system and should be reworked as soon as possible.\n
