RELEASE News of rcssserver3d-0.6.3

In this release, we are preparing for a simulation with more robots than before.
The current target is to have 6 vs 6 games, so we have made some changes to
make the simulator more suitable for it. The most notable changes made in
rcssserver3d package in this direction are:
1. Disabling the internal monitor by default: starting from this version, the
simulation server (simspark binary, now called rcssserver3d) no longer brings
up a monitor when run. To actually view the simulation, a monitor (e.g.
rcsmonitor3d which is included in this package) should be run separately. This
separation noticeably improves the performance of the server. A new executable
called "rcsoccersim3d" is provided which runs both the simulation server and a 
monitor on the local machine. 
2. Bigger field: in this version, field dimensions and goal width are 1.5 times
larger than before to provide enough area for 6 vs 6 games.

* New names:
  - rcssserver3d: the old simspark binary has been renamed to rcssserver3d, as
    it more clearly shows the functionality of the simulator. A symbolic link
    called simspark is provided for compatibility.
  - rcsoccersim3d: as stated above, running rcssserver3d (formerly simspark)
    no longer starts a monitor to view the simulation, and a monitor should be
    run separately. For users' convenience a new executable called rcsoccersim3d
    is provided which runs both rcssserver3d and rcssmonitor3 to connect to
    the running simulator. 

* Other notable changes:
 - Added HMDP effector/perceptor
 - Some compilation fixes
 - Improved Windows support
