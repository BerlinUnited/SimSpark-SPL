For later:

- To simulate aerodynamic drag, it would be better to use the square
  of the velocity, because that's how drag works in reality. The force
  should also be applied at the object's aerodynamic center rather
  than at the body location. These may be the same, but (especially if
  you're using geometry transforms) they may not be. The center of the
  object's cross section would probably be close to the aerodynamic
  center, at least for non-engineering purposes. In any case,
  dBodyAddForceAtRelPos? will allow you to apply the force at a
  specific point in the body's frame of reference.

- Note that if when simulating rolling friction, you should only apply
  the damping when the object is actually touching the ground. Check
  for the existence of a contact joint between the object and the
  ground, for example.

For 0.3:

- add kick off selection to monitor (left/right/random)
- The default LogServer behavior is to open cout for eAll. When an application
  wants to change this, zeitgeist sent already some Debug messages, which may
  be desired or not. The application should be able to change this as well.

Done:

- add rule to get rid of this message (ScriptServer) ERROR: Unknown function 'RuleFreeKickPauseTime'
- adjust goal height (and the goal flags position in the lite monitor)
- remove error message 'failed to get Class object for 'ClassClass0x804ad24'...#
- monitor / logplayer should work without changing config files
- Kicker: solve effet
- Kicker: latitudal angle
- Kick and run team
- Agents need to get information about team
- Flag names
- Game States:
  before kick off
  kick in: ball inside field
  goal_l / goal_right 
  corner_kick
  goal_kick_l / r (beam ball in front of goal)  
  half time (timing?)
- change play mode from monitor
- ODE joint types
