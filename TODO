===== Dez 31 2003

Currently, most soccer specific stuff is missing. Things
like rules, score, and a real soccer field have to be implemented
next. The basic infrastructure for all these lacking features has 
already been created so that a version 0.2 should be ready in near 
future. 

Branch: rcssserver3D-0.2

  - add some control aspects
    Control aspects will be responsible for setting a game state,
    controlling the use of effectors and the soccer rules. A first
    possible control aspect could be one setting the game state (like
    play_on, before_kick_off, ...). Other CAs in later versions.

  - add more effectors / perceptors

Branch: rcssserver3D-0.3
This should be the branch where the latest changes for Lisbon are
introduced. In parallel, we will be working here on more features for
RoboCup 2005 on a different branch.

Branch: rcssserver3D-X.Y
We are going to add joints and more of the more advanced ODE stuff
during winter/spring/summer 2004. Joschka from my group here is
already working on a way to integrate bones into the simulator (so we
will get articulated creatures for RoboCup 2005).
