Branch: rcssserver3D-0.3
This should be the branch where the latest changes for Lisbon are
introduced. In parallel, we will be working here on more features for
RoboCup 2005 on a different branch.

Branch: rcssserver3D-X.Y
We are going to add joints and more of the more advanced ODE stuff
during winter/spring/summer 2004. Joschka from my group here is
already working on a way to integrate bones into the simulator (so we
will get articulated creatures for RoboCup 2005).
