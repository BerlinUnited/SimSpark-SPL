===== Dez 22 2003

Branch: rcssserver3D-0.1
This branch should be created from the main branch once
rcssserver3D-add-gamecontrol is merged back. I'd like to release
rcssserver3D-0.1 on Dec 31 at the latest. Things to do that should be
included until then are
- more cleanup for the 'make dist' target (Oliver)
- generate a document describing general stuff (what can we do now,
  what's still to do, and want we to do, open issues, where to find help,...)
- fix bug that sense events do not seem to get back to agents
- integrate our basic monitor 

Branch: rcssserver3D-0.2
  - add some control aspects
  - add more effectors / perceptors

Branch: rcssserver3D-0.3
This should be the branch where the latest changes for Lisbon are
introduced. In parallel, we will be working here on more features for
RoboCup 2005 on a different branch.

Branch: rcssserver3D-X.Y
We are going to add joints and more of the more advanced ODE stuff
during winter/spring/summer 2004. Joschka from my group here is
already working on a way to integrate bones into the simulator (so we
will get articulated creatures).
