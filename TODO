For 0.3:

- add kick off selection to monitor (left/right/random)
- The default LogServer behavior is to open cout for eAll. When an application
  wants to change this, zeitgeist sent already some Debug messages, which may
  be desired or not. The application should be able to change this as well.

Done:

- add rule to get rid of this message (ScriptServer) ERROR: Unknown function 'RuleFreeKickPauseTime'
- adjust goal height (and the goal flags position in the lite monitor)
- remove error message 'failed to get Class object for 'ClassClass0x804ad24'...#
- monitor / logplayer should work without changing config files
- Kicker: solve effet
- Kicker: latitudal angle
- Kick and run team
- Agents need to get information about team
- Flag names
- Game States:
  before kick off
  kick in: ball inside field
  goal_l / goal_right 
  corner_kick
  goal_kick_l / r (beam ball in front of goal)  
  half time (timing?)
- change play mode from monitor
- ODE joint types
