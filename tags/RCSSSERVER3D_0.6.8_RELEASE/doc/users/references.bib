	Abstract = {We describe a new multi-agent simulation system, called Spark, for agents in three-dimensional environments. Our goal in creating Spark was to provide a high degree of flexibility for creating new types of simulations. We implemented a flexible application framework and exhausted the idea of replaceable components in the resulting system. In comparison to specialized simulators, users can effortlessly create new simulations by using a scene description language. 
Spark is a powerful tool to state different multi-agent research questions. It was already used as official simulator for the first three-dimensional RoboCup Simulation League competition.},

Using this approach, we implemented a generic simulator which is totally decoupled from the actual simulation it performs. We believe that for Soccer Simulation League a transition to 3D states exiting new research problems and equally makes it more attractive to watch for spectators. We are proposing to use our framework as basis for a next generation Soccer Server.
