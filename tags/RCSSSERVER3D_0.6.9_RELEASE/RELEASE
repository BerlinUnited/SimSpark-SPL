RELEASE News of rcssserver3d-0.6.9

This release comes with a number of bug fixes and also adds some new features
to enhance managing games and also to add more challenges to games, most notably
adding noise to the beam effector. The changes are:

* Rule Changes:
  - Added new rule requiring that the ball must either touch an opponent, or
    touch a teammate outside the center circle, before a team taking a
    kickoff can score.
  - Penalty shootout kickoffs are direct now.

* New Features:
  - Added noise to the beam effector with the amount of noise added controlled
    by the 'BeamNoiseXY' (in meters) and 'BeamNoiseAngle' (in degrees)
    values in naosoccersim.rb.  Noise is added to beam X and Y values from
    a uniform distribution within the range [-BeamNoiseXY, BeamNoiseXY]
    and to beam angle values from a uniform distribution within the range
    [-BeamNoiseAngle, BeamNoiseAngle].
  - Added new training command parser commands for setting the game time and
    score.  They are the following commands:
        (time <time>)
        (score (left <score>) (right <score>))
  - Added penalty shootout mode where a goal is awarded to the left team
    (penalty kicker) if the right team's player (penalty goalie) leaves the
    penalty area.

* Bug fixes:
  - Fixing a bug with free kicks where as soon as the ball was touched,
    and the playmode transitioned from freekick to play on, the ball was
    still moved back to the location of the freekick preventing the ball from
    being directly kicked out of a free kick. Also ensuring that the ball
    position for free kicks is updated correctly as this wasn't happening
    right after the ball was placed back at the center of the field after
    a goal was scored.
  - Fixing a bug where a player would be incorrectly called for double
    touching the ball on a kickoff if the player first kicked the ball
    directly in the opponent's goal from a kickoff, resulting in no goal
    being awarded a nd the opposing team being given a kickoff, and then is
    the next player to touch the ball in the PlayOn playmode after a dropball
    when the opponent doesn't take their kickoff.
  - Fixing a bug where rules such as too many players in their own penalty
    area was not being enforced.
