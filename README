To compile and run rcssserver3D, you need ode installed on your system
(see http://www.q12.org/ode/ode.html).

Additionally, the drawstuff stuff from ODE is used for debugging purposes. 
After installing ODE simply copy the ode-0.03/include/drawstuff/ and 
ode-0.03/lib/librawstuff.a to suitable places, e.g.

       include/drawstuff  --> /usr/local/include/drawstuff
       lib/libdrawstuff.a --> /usr/local/lib/libdrawstuff.a
