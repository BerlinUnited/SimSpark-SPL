\chapter{Development Conventions}

We agreed on a set of conventions that you should apply to when you
contribute to the development.

\begin{itemize}

\item{CVS tagging}

Developing and testing an new feature of Simspark is usually done on a
separate CVS branch. We implemented the following convention to tag
the branch and trunk before and after merging and branching takes
place:

Before branching off the trunk is tagged \texttt{BRANCHNAME\_base} in
order to mark the last CVS state before the branch is started.

Each time before a branch is merged back to the trunk the trunk ist tagged 
\texttt{BRANCHNAME\_premergeN}. The value \texttt{N} increases with each separate merge. 
After the branch is merged the trunk is tagged
\texttt{BRANCHNAME\_postmergeN} and the merged branched is tagged
\texttt{BRANCHNAME\_mergedN}

\end{itemize}
