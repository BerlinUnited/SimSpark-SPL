\section{Writing a class object for a C++ class}
\label{sec:classobj}

This topic is fundamental in the understanding of how the class object
and the object hierarchy framework interact with each other. Let's say
we have a simple class:

\begin{verbatim}

class Simple
{
public:
  Simple();
  virtual ~Simple();
  
  void DoSomething();
  void PrintString(const std::string& s);
  void PrintInt(int i);
  void PrintFloat(float f);
  void PrintBool(bool b);
};

\end{verbatim}

Now, in order to write a class object for this class we must do two
things: First, the class must derive from the
\texttt{zeitgeist::Object} class or one of its descendants,
especially \texttt{Leaf} and \texttt{Node} if instances of this class
are to live in the object hierarchy. In addition to this, a class
object must be declared and defined, which serves as a factory for
instances of this class.

The first step is performed easily:

\begin{verbatim}
#include <zeitgeist/leaf.h>

class Simple : public zeitgeist::Leaf
{
public:
  Simple();
  virtual ~Simple();
  
  void DoSomething();
  void PrintString(const std::string& s);
  void PrintInt(int i);
  void PrintFloat(float f);
  void PrintBool(bool b);
};
\end{verbatim}

Now, we just have to write a class object for this class. As this is a
pretty repetitive procedure, several helper-macros exist to make this
as painless as possible. First, we declare the class object. This is
done in the header file with the \texttt{DECLARE\_CLASS()}-macro:

\begin{verbatim}
#include <zeitgeist/leaf.h>

class Simple : public zeitgeist::Leaf
{
public:
  Simple();
  virtual ~Simple();
  
  void DoSomething();
  void PrintString(const std::string& s);
  void PrintInt(int i);
  void PrintFloat(float f);
  void PrintBool(bool b);
};

DECLARE_CLASS(Simple);
\end{verbatim}

With this macro, we declare the class object. If \texttt{Simple} would
have been an abstract base class (containing one or more pure virtual
functions) we would have needed to use the
\texttt{DECLARE\_ABSTRACTCLASS()}-macro instead. 

Both of these macros create a new class with the mangled name
\texttt{Class\_XXXX}, where \texttt{XXXX} is the name of the class. 
In our case this would be \texttt{Class\_Simple}. This class is derived
from \texttt{zeitgeist::Class}. In the case of
\texttt{DECLARE\_CLASS()} the macro also provides a \texttt{CreateInstance()}
function, which creates an instance of the Simple class. 

The \texttt{DECLARE\_ABSTRACTCLASS()} macro does not do this, as it is
impossible to create an instance of an abstract class. It inherits the
base behavior from zeitgeist::Class, which just returns
\texttt{NULL}. 

In addition to this, both macros declare a \texttt{DefineClass()}
member function, which needs to be implemented to define the class
object fully. This is done in an additional \texttt{CPP} file. If the
class above was implemented in the files \texttt{simple.h} and
\texttt{simple.cpp}, the accompanying class object should be placed in
the file \texttt{simple\_c.cpp}. This naming convention has been found
useful during development and should be adopted. A minimal
\texttt{simple\_c.cpp} should look like this:

\begin{verbatim}
#include "simple.h"

using namespace zeitgeist;

void CLASS(Simple)::DefineClass()
{
  DEFINE_BASECLASS(zeitgeist/Leaf);
}
\end{verbatim}


The \texttt{CLASS()}-macro is used to identify the name of the class
object. In the above example, it just resolves to
\texttt{Class\_Simple}. The \texttt{DEFINE\_BASECLASS()} macro is used to 
identify the base class of the class described by this class
object. This can appear multiple times to allow for multiple
inheritance. We now have a working class object. In order to use it it
must be registered to the zeitgeist framework. This process is
described in section \ref{sec:regobj}.

\section{Registering a Class Object}
\label{sec:regobj}

In section \ref{sec:classobj} we created a class object for the C++
class \texttt{Simple}. Before this class object can be used by the
zeitgeist framework it must be registered with a
\texttt{zeitgeist::Core} object. 

The Core is the object hierarchy, which is basically a virtual file
system where instances of classes represent the directories and
'files'. Therefore, each class instance can be identified by a
path. The Core has a function called \texttt{RegisterClassObject()}
which inserts the class object into the object hierarchy. Class
objects are located under the \texttt{'/classes/'} branch of the
hierarchy. We have two major scenarios of how a class object can be
registered: Directly or indirectly!

\subsection{Direct Registration}

This scenario is used in the case of static libraries and executables,
which want to expose custom classes to the object hierarchy. An
example of a library, which does this is Kerosin. This way of
registering is pretty straight forward and involves an initialization
function which has a means to access the \texttt{zeitgeist::Core}
instance where the class objects are to be registered. Then it
(directly) calls the \texttt{RegisterClassObject()}-method to
successively add class objects. Here's a short snippet from the
Kerosin library:

\begin{verbatim}
#include "kerosin.h"
#include <zeitgeist/scriptserver/scriptserver.h>

using namespace kerosin;
using namespace zeitgeist;

Kerosin::Kerosin(zeitgeist::Zeitgeist &zg)
{
  zg.GetCore()->RegisterClassObject(new CLASS(SoundServer), "kerosin/");

  zg.GetCore()->RegisterClassObject(new CLASS(InputServer), "kerosin/");

  zg.GetCore()->RegisterClassObject(new CLASS(ImageServer), "kerosin/");

  zg.GetCore()->RegisterClassObject(new CLASS(FontServer), "kerosin/");

  zg.GetCore()->RegisterClassObject(new CLASS(OpenGLServer), "kerosin/");
\end{verbatim}

The Kerosin library is initialized by creating an instance of the
Kerosin class. The constructor needs a reference to the Zeitgeist
object (which represents the Zeitgeist library), so it can get access
to the Core. The class objects are all added to the object hierarchy
under the \texttt{'/classes/'} branch. 

The second parameter of \texttt{RegisterClassObject()} allows to
specify an additional sub path. So, the class object for the
SoundServer (for example) will be located at
\texttt{'/classes/kerosin/SoundServer'}. In in a way, this allows to create a
form of namespaces among the class objects. As we can see, it is
possible to add a class object directly at any time during the
execution of the program.

\subsection{Indirect Registration}

The second scenario involves packaging a bunch of class objects into a
shared library. On Unix platform these files are called \texttt{.so}
files. In the Windows world thees files are \texttt{.DLLs}. The shared
library is used as a class library, containing a collection of classes
to be added to the object hierarchy. This kind of library is referred
to as a \texttt{Bundle}. 

The Bundle contains a well defined entry point function, which
registers its contents with the calling Core. This is simplified
through the use of several macros. First, we have to create a shared
library project, containing a bunch of classes and their corresponding
class objects. This process is described in section
\ref{sec:classobj}. Then, we create an additional \texttt{.CPP} file. By convention
this file is called \texttt{export.cpp}. Let's say we have two classes
in our bundle, \texttt{Simple} and \texttt{Complex}. The corresponding
\texttt{export.cpp} would look like this:

\begin{verbatim}
#include "simple.h"
#include "complex.h"
#include <zeitgeist/zeitgeist.h>

ZEITGEIST_EXPORT_BEGIN()
  ZEITGEIST_EXPORT(Simple);
  ZEITGEIST_EXPORT(Complex);
ZEITGEIST_EXPORT_END()
\end{verbatim}


Thanks to the macros, this is again a quite compact notation. We just
include the header files of all classes we want to expose. These
should also incorporate the correct class object declarations. Then we
include the zeitgeist framework. The following macros implement the
entry point function. \texttt{ZEITGEIST\_EXPORT\_BEGIN()} implements
the beginning of the function. Then we use
\texttt{ZEITGEIST\_EXPORT()} for every class we want to export, and
finally \texttt{ZEITGEIST\_EXPORT\_END()} to 'terminate' the
function. The compiled library is then a Zeitgeist-capable Bundle. The
\texttt{ZEITGEIST\_EXPORT\_EX()} macro can be used to specify a subpath as above
with \texttt{RegisterClassObject()}.


To indirectly register the classes contained in a Bundle, you just
import the bundle into the Core. This is done with the
\texttt{ImportBundle()}-member function. This function opens the shared
library. Gets the entry point function and calls it with an STL
list. The class objects are added to this list within the entry point
function. After returning, all class objects contained in this list
are added to the object hierarchy.
