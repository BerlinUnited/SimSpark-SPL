    <h1>Implementation</h1>

    <h2>General Information</h2>

    <p>
      rcssserver3D is a physical simulation system. The primary
      purpose of this system is to provide a *generic* simulator for
      different kinds of simulations. In these simulations, agents can
      participate as external processes. To create specific
      simulations, important parts of the simulator are build as
      plugins that can be replaced for different simulations. The
      plugins can be exchanged at runtime. Things designed as plugins
      are for example parts of agents: agents can be using different
      actuators or perceptors. Other plugins are responsible for the
      simulator protocol or also for the rules of specific
      simulations.<br>
      Simulations for this simulator can be constructed to a great part
      by changing text files with no further recompilation. The soccer 
      simulation makes not yet use of this feature, but changes towards
      this are already planned.
    </p>

    <p>
      The simulation system was created with a specific simulation in
      mind, that is a 3D physical soccer simulation for RoboCup
      Simulation league. To this end, this distribution contains a set
      of plugins for RoboCup Soccer Simulation League. The soccer
      simulator can be found in the <tt>./app/simulator/</tt> subdirectory.
      The basic simulator concept was presented on the 2003 RoboCup
      Symposium in Padova [1].
    </p>

    <p>
      For scientific simulations, it is useful to be able to keep
      track of the time used by different agents for thinking. A
      special plugin makes it possible to use the simulator together
      with SPADES, a middleware system for agent based
      simulations. SPADES was presented on the 2002 RoboCup Symposium
      in Fukuoka [2] (SPADES itself is not part of this package).

    <p>
      If you installed rcssserver3D-0.2.x or 0.1 before, make sure to clean the 
      <nobr>~/.rcssserver3D/</nobr> directory prior to using the new version. Also better remove the old installed 
      libraries in /usr/local/lib/rcssserver3D manually. Sorry for this inconvenience.

    <h2>Package Overview</h2>

    <p>
      The different parts of this package are organized in different
      directories as follows: 
    </p>

    <table>
	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>./app/</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    Different applications. These applications are
	    mostly tests of different subsystems of the
	    simulator. Additionaly, there is  
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>./app/simulator/</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    The soccer simulator.
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>./app/rcssmonitor3d/</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    A simple monitor that displays agents connected to the
	    simulator.
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>./app/agenttest/</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    A 'hello world' agent (does nothing very useful, kick and run soccer).
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>./lib/</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    The main simulator parts as libraries. The
	    simulator consists of these parts:
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>./lib/salt/</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    This library provides a collection of useful general
	    purpose classes. It contains mostly math-and 
	    system-related functionality, such as a 3D Vector
	    class, a Matrix class, a file I/O wrapper and an 
	    abstraction for loading/accessing shared libraries.
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>./lib/zeitgeist/</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    The Zeitgeist library provides two major features. It
	    implements a mechanism to work with class objects
	    in C++. A class object is just a factory of class
	    instances. In addition to this mechanism, it also
	    implements an object hierarchy. This hierarchy is
	    essentially a virtual file system, where the
	    'directories' and 'files' are instances of C++
	    classes. These two concepts are quite intertwined
	    with each other, as class objects can also live
	    inside the object hierarchy. Objects within the
	    hierarchy are identified with a unique name. On
	    top of these two features, the Zeitgeist library
	    also provides three very important 'built-in'
	    services. Each basic service is usually
	    represented by a 'server' class in our
	    terminology. An instance of such a class provides
	    the service to other parts of the system. The
	    three services built into the Zeitgeist library
	    are the LogServer, the FileServer, and the
	    ScriptServer.
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>./lib/oxygen/</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    Oxygen is the actual engine which is used for the
	    simulation. It is implemented on top of the
	    Zeitgeist framework and provides a multitude of
	    different services to a client application. It
	    handles the physics aspect (PhysicsServer), the 
	    geometry aspect (PhysicsServer) and the agent
	    aspect (AgentAspect, ControlAspect). Another
	    important part of this library is performing the 
	    world simulation (SceneServer).
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>./lib/kerosin/</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    Kerosin handles the visualization aspect 
	    (ImageServer, FontServer, OpenGLServer, TextureServer,
	    MaterialServer). The classes in the library also
	    provide basic interfaces for receiving input in
	    interactive simulations (InputServer)
	    and for playing sounds (SoundServer). Currently, it is not 
	    used for the simulator.
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>./plugins/</tt></td>
	  <td>directory containing plugins to extend the simulator</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt></td><td></td></tr>

      <li>if during linking the compiler complains that it cannot find <tt>-lslang</tt>,
	set a symbolic link <tt>/usr/lib/libslang.so</tt> linking 
	to <tt>/usr/lib/libslang.so.1</tt></li>
