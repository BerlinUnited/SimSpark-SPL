<p align="left"><font size="4">The ScriptServer allows executing the contents 
  of files and strings via the Ruby scripting language, as well as provide access 
  to script-side variables. The implementation also provides the necessary glue 
  code to allow the script-side to execute C++ functions. The necessary wrapper 
  code for this is part of the class object definition. Every pair of cpp/h files 
  which is part of the Zeitgeist framework has a third file associated with it. 
  The filename is post-fixed with a '_c' and it contains the class object definition, 
  as well as the script-side interface.</font></p>
