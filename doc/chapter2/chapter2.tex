\chapter{Programming Environment under Linux}


\section{Requirements}

Besides the existing tools needed for compiling C++ code a few libraries and
header files have to be installed on your system.

Here is a list of packages needed for compilation together with a link for downloading them:

\begin{itemize}
\item openGL (www.opengl.org)
\item \textbf{\emph{S}}imple \textbf{\emph{D}}irectMedia \textbf{\emph{L}}ayer
(www.libsdl.org)
\item ode (sourceforge.net/projects/opende)
\item DevIL (openil.sourceforge.net)
\item Ruby (www.ruby-lang.org)
\item boost (www.boost.org)
\end{itemize}
All of the other stuff should come with your linux-distribution.


\section{Compile the Project}

Make sure to read the installation instructions (TODO Viktor: which? link? I suggest to put here!) 
for more details.
But in most cases a simple \emph{./configure \&\& make} or \emph{autoconfigure}
should be enough. If something is missing the configure-script will
tell you.


\section{Most common Problems}

TODO Viktor: Maybe just link to chapter 5 or directly to the pages in sourceforge
