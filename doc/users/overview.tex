 \chapter{System Overview}

%Briefly introduce the system and its components. Later chapters go into more detail.


SimSpark is built upon an application framework called Zeitgeist. This
framework provides basic OS abstractions like file and archive
support, logging, shared libraries etc.), a scripting interface to
Ruby and a powerful plugin mechanism coupled with a object hierary
that provides a unified namespace. This library is the backbone of the
system.

Zeitgeist allows us to load new classes at runtime from plugins and
install instances in the object hierarchy. We can locate these
instances via path expression like files in a file system. At various
well known locations are objects that provide services to other parts
of the system (e.g. the ScriptServer at /sys/server/script).

Built as part of this object hierarchy is a scene graph that is the in
system representation of the simulated world. The scene graph and
related concepts are modeled within the next layer of the system,
called oxygen. It provides classes that encapsulate concepts like
transformations, geometric object, physical bodies and collision
primitives and interfaces them to a rigid body simulation.

The oxygen library further implements basic simulation services like
agent management, a monitor framework and basic effector/robot/eceptor
classes. Further a customizable run loop is implemented that can be
extended as needed.

Visualization and input handling is provided by the kerosin
library. It provides the infrastructure for rendering and device
management. Concrete implementations are provided by plugins. A
default set of plugins utilizes OpenGL and the SDL library.


\section{The Server}

%Describe what the server does: physics, agent management, world modeling, ...

\section{The Monitor and Logplayer}

%Generic monitor, can be customized with plug-ins to display simulation specific stuff, internal & external version, log playing, ...

\section{The Sample Client}

%Demo client, demonstrates interaction with the server, how to read perceptor values, how to send effector values, can load different behaviors

%Provide links to a reositoriy of clients / papers from previous competitions?
