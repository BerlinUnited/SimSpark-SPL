\chapter{Unit tests with CPPUnit}

CppUnit is the C++ port of the famous JUnit framework for unit testing. Test %%@
output is in XML or text format for automatic testing and GUI based for %%@
supervised tests.


\section{Downloads}

The important files can all be downloaded from the CPPUnit file
page:
\begin{verbatim}
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=11795
\end{verbatim}

At the moment, the latest version of CPPUnit is 1.8.0

For the first steps you only must download the following files:
\begin{itemize}
\item cppunit-1.8.0.tar.gz
\item cppunit-docs-1.8.0.tar.gz
\end{itemize}

\section{Installation under Unix}

I haven't tried to install the CPPUnit library under a Linux System, yet.

\section{Installation under Windows}

At the current time, the only supported WIN32 platform is Microsoft Visual C++. %%@
You must have VC++ 6.0 at least.

I tried it with MS Visual C++ Standard Edition and it worked.

The libraries and DLL can all be built from the %%@
\textit{src/CppUnitLibraries.dsw} workspace which is placed in your CPPUnit %%@
directory.

These are only the first steps. For additional information read the %%@
\textit{INSTALL-WIN32.TXT} placed in the CPPUnit directory. There you also have %%@
a list of the different libraries and you can choose your
preferred library.

To write your first unit tests with MS Visual C++, you have do the following %%@
steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item RTTI must be enabled (Project -> Settings -> C++ -> C++ Language)
\item link against \textit{lib/cppunitXX.lib} (XX for the chosen library)
\item write the include directory of your cppunit directory in the search path
\end{itemize}

\section{The documentation}

There are two ways to integrate the documentation of the CPPUnit library. The %%@
documentation can be integrated in the MSDN library or simply can be read as %%@
HTML version.

To use the HTML documentaion extract the archieve cppunit-docs-1.8.0.tar.gz to %%@
the directory where you want to have the documentation and then start with the %%@
index.html in any browser you want.

If you want to integrate the documentation in the MSDN library you must %%@
download \begin{verbatim} CppUnitMsdnDoc-1_8_0.zip \end{verbatim}, read the %%@
\textit{Installing-Doc.txt} and follow the steps mentioned there.
I also haven't tried this way, yet.

\section{First unit tests}

To write your first unit tests follow the instructions in the
\begin{verbatim} CPPUnit Cookbook \end{verbatim} which you can find on the first page of
the HTML documentation.

Another way to learn how to make unit tests is, to watch any existing example %%@
for unit test and try to understand what they do there.

More instructions will follow soon.
