HOW TO INSTALL REQUIRED LIBRARIES

FMOD
	- Unpack the .tar.gz file. 
	- Move the header files from the ./api/inc/ directory in the package 
          into a "fmod/" directory in your "include" tree, e.g.
          /usr/local/include/fmod/
        - Move the library (the libfmod-X.YZ.so file) from the ./api/ directory of 
	  the package into a library tree, e.g. /usr/local/lib/. 
        - Create a symbolic link from /usr/local/lib/libfmod.so (or whatever directory 
          you've chosen) to the fmod library.
