Dear all,

we have just released a bugfix release of rcssserver3D (rcssserver3D-0.2.1). 
It removes some  (but not all) bugs we found or someone else reported in 
rcssserver3D-0.2. 

- Configuration was made a little stricter and more complete so that
  it should be easier to install the whole thing.
- The missing agenttest.rb file is included into the distribution
- The Makefile.am's have been fixed for those not building the libkerosin part.
- A fix for the recent SPADES [1] versions has been added.
- A major bug with the weight of objects in the simulation has been removed.
  The dynamics of the drive of the robots and of the kicker have been adapted.
  (This bug was found after a report from Nuno Lau on the sserver list).
- The artificial slowdown of bodies has been removed. 
- The default timer of the sample agents (agenttest) is now jiffies.

A few features have been added to the zeitgeist library. This is mostly stuff 
dealing with the ruby interface.

A major "feature" that has not been changed in this release is the referee 
announcing the play modes. We are working on this.

You can get the package on the Soccer Simulator page on SourceForge [2].

cheers
Oliver Obst
