We have just released version 0.5.3 of rcssserver3D. This release
contains some fixes for the offside code and some eye candy for the
lite monitor. Furthermore, it includes the new Fujitsu HOAP-2 inspired
robot for simspark as well as the derived SoccerBot (work in
progress), and some improvements to the physics code (mainly related
to stability issues).

- rcssmonitor3D-lite features a sky box (thanks to Heni Ben Amor) and improved 
  colors and lights (thanks to Tobias Warden). Please see the comment about
  texture files in the INSTALL file.

- simspark includes hoap2.rsg and soccerbot.rsg robot models

- agent communication was restricted to a message length of 20 Bytes in
  rcssserver3D

- several fixes in the rcssmonitor3D-lite, rcssserver3D, and simspark. For
  details, please see the NEWS file. Thanks go to Junquing Wang and Sander
  van Dijk.

You can find the package at the usual place [1].

Please note that you should update the rcssserver3D.rb file in your
~/.rcssserver3d/ directory manually (again).

Cheers
Joschka (for the maintenance comittee)

We have just released rcssserver3D-0.5.3. 

rcssserver3D is a multi-agent simulation system for physical agents in
three-dimensional environments. It features a flexible application
framework and a scene description language for setting up different
kinds of simulations. The soccer simulation built on top of this is used
in the RoboCup 3D Soccer Simulation League.

Important fixes and new features:

- the visualization features a sky box and other eye candy now.

- includes the first prototypes of humanoid robot models

- agent communication was restricted to a message length of 20 Bytes 

- several fixes in the rcssmonitor3D-lite, rcssserver3D, and simspark

For details have a look into the ChangeLog coming with the package.

You can get the package on the Soccer Simulator page on SourceForge
at http://sourceforge.net/projects/sserver/
