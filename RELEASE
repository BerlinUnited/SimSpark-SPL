RELEASE News of rcssserver3d-0.5.9

This release is the candidate of RoboCup 2008. There are some
important improvements. Firstly, the physics parameters are well
adjust to make the simulation more real and stable. Secondly, the
restrict vision perceptor is used, which the vision range is limited,
but more details will be seen, i.e. the head, hands and feet of robots
can be seen. Furthermore, the some soccer rule and visual features are
improved.

* Physics Parameters:
 Some physics parameters are adjusted to make the simulation more real
 and stable.
 - Joint parameters: the max force and max speed of the joint are
 restricted, and some other parameters are modified.
 - Ball parameters: the parameters of drag are modified.

* Restrict Vision: 
 The restrict vision perceptor is installed both in nao and
 soccerbot058. This perceptor have some restriction compared with
 original vision perceptor. Firstly, the robots can only see object in
 the limited angle range (both horizontal and vertical angle ranges
 are [-60, 60] in degree). Secondly, the frequent is restricted, the
 robot can get one vision message every 3 cycles. Furthermore, note
 that the noise is added to the vision information.

 However, the information is richer: the robot's torso, head, hands
 and feet can be seen. The flags placed in the field can also be seen
 (They are no visual in the screen now, but the robot can see them).
 Four flags are placed at the field corners (the height is 0), and the
 four flags are placed at the goal posts (the corner of the goal).

* Visual:
 - The Nao robot can be identified by team colors and numbers. You can
 play a match with Nao robots ;-)
 - the monitor camera can be controlled by number keys (from 1 to 7)

* Soccer Rule:
 - Field Size: the field size is 12mx8m, the center circle radius is
1.3m, the penalty size is 1.2mx4m. More information please see
naosoccersim.rb.
 - Kick Off: the kick off team can enter the center circle, and the
   opponents will be moved away from the center circle.
