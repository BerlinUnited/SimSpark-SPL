Hi all,

we have just released an initial version of rcssserver3D. rcssserver3D
is a physical simulation system. The primary purpose of this
system is to provide a generic simulator for different kinds of
simulations. 

With rcssserver3D, we also started working towards a specific soccer
simulation for RoboCup Simulation league. Even though this work is not
finished yet, we decided to release a first version of the simulator
as it is now. Currently, most soccer specific stuff is missing. Things
like rules, score, and a real soccer field have to be implemented
next. Differences to the version we have been showing on the
RoboCup-2003 symposium [1] are that the basic infrastructure for
these lacking features has already been created, distributing the
agents is already supported, and the simulator is running on Linux.
We are already working on a version 0.2 which should be ready in near
future. 

The basic intention of this release is that teams can start playing
around with the simulator. Hopefully, until teams have finished their
first steps, we can come up with some more features towards a (more 
complete) real soccer simulation. 

Specific features of the simulator are quite different from the
current (2D) simulator. One of these features is for example the use
of SPADES as middleware between simulator and agents. SPADES has been
introduced by Pat Riley on the RoboCup-2002 symposium [2]. To compile
the simulator, you need to install SPADES on your system. The list of
additional required libraries for rcssserver3D can be found in the
(admittedly terse) documentation. The greatest part of the
documentation consists of the source code itself, i.e. to get started,
it is very probable that you need to look into the simulator sources.

To create new soccer clients, you need to create agents compatible
with SPADES. You can get extensive documentation together with the
SPADES library [3]. We also included a very primitive agent (that
does nothing).

Last but not least, there is also a very simple monitor to visualize
agents (agents are spheres for now). You need OpenGL and libglut for
the monitor.

You can get the package on the Soccer Simulator page on 
SourceForge [4].

So much for this year :-)
with best wishes for 2004
