We have just released version 0.5.6 of rcssserver3D. This is the final release
for the competition in Atlanta, GA. The simulator now contains the new timer
running in single-threaded mode by default. We also re-integrated the soccer rules
plug-in (communication and offside not supported yet). Furthermore, we
completed the game state info display in both the internal and external
monitors, and fixed the trainer command parser to work with the new
agents. The SoccerBot model was modified, the performance was slightly
improved, and several bugs were fixed.

* Important fixes:

beameffector & singlematiniteffector:
- fixed beaming with rotation

gyrorateperceptor:
- output is now in the local coordinate system of the robot

trainercommandparser:
- fixed several methods to work with the new agent

* Features:

- new GameTimePerceptor added which senses game time instead of sim time (not
  used in Atlanta)
- GameStatePerceptor added which provides the agent with information about the
  current game state (play mode, game time, unum, and side)
- play modes and rules re-integrated (no communication and no offside yet)
- slight performance improvement by caching references to important classes
- game state info display fixed in the internal and external monitors
- key bindings for 7 different camera positions, kick off, and drop ball
- the SoccerBot was modified to have a two-part torso to facilitate stand-up
  motions, it got colliders (and very small masses) at the hands, it uses the
  ForceResistanceReceptor instead of the TouchPerceptor
- the hinge joint and universal joint effectors will not set any velocity if a
  joint stop is reached to prevent large forces and instabilities (not used in Atlanta)
- the maximum joint velocity that can be requested was restricted to 9000
  deg/sec (for stability reasons)
- Field size was reduced to 50m x 32m, penalty area reduced to 8m x 19.5m
- Goal size was increased to 9m width and 4m height
- The ball model was improved according to suggestions from wjq and Tobias Warden
- The visualization of the corner flags was moved back to allow proper corner kicks

You can find the package at the usual place [1]. 

Please note that you will also need an additional package
(rcssserver3d-0.5.5-data.tar.gz, no change from the last release) containing
data files (models, textures) that is available at the same location. This
package should be extracted in the installation directory of rcssserver3D
(/usr/local/share/rcssserver3d if the default prefix has not been changed).

Cheers
Joschka (for the maintenance comittee)

** [General (SF Project News etc)]

We have just released rcssserver3d-0.5.6. 

rcssserver3D is a multi-agent simulation system for physical agents in
three-dimensional environments. It features a flexible application
framework and a scene description language for setting up different
kinds of simulations. The soccer simulation built on top of this is used
in the RoboCup 3D Soccer Simulation League.

Important fixes and new features:

- new GameTimePerceptor added which senses game time instead of sim time

- play modes and rules re-integrated (no communication and no offside yet)

- slight performance improvement by caching references to important classes

- game state info display fixed in the internal and external monitors

- key bindings for 7 different camera positions, kick off, and drop ball

- the SoccerBot was modified to have a two-part torso to facilitate stand-up
  motions, it got colliders (and very small masses) at the hands, it uses the
  ForceResistanceReceptor instead of the TouchPerceptor, and it uses joint
  stops to eliminate "unrealistic" movements

- the hinge joint and universal joint effectors will not set any velocity if a
  joint stop is reached to prevent large forces and instabilities

- the maximum joint velocity that can be requested was restricted to 9000
  deg/sec (for stability reasons also)

- Field size was reduced to 45m x 30m

- Goal size was increased to 9m width and 4m height

- The ball model was improved according to suggestions from the community

- The visualization of the corner flags was moved back to allow proper corner kicks

For details have a look into the ChangeLog coming with the package.

You can get the package on the Soccer Simulator page on SourceForge
at http://sourceforge.net/projects/sserver/
