we have just released version 0.5.2 of rcssserver3D. This is mainly a bug fix
release to get a more stable version and change some parameters for the
RoboCup-2006 in Bremen. Some new features, mainly in the monitor are
introduced as well: 

- we received a patch from Tobias Warden to fix compilation problems with gcc
  4.1.

- the goal height and the catch margin have been changed because of a stronger
  goalie and the offside implementation.

- Ali Nadalizadeh sent a patch to enable the monitor to step backwards when
  playing logfiles and implements new camera modes. 

- Ma Jie sent a patch to improve the mousehandling in the monitor.

- several problems in the offside code, the kickeffector, the sayeffector,
  and the pan/tilt effector have been fixed. Thanks go to Yuan Xu and Nima
  Aghaeepour.

You can find the package at the usual place [1].

Please note that you should update the rcssserver3D.rb file in your
~/.rcssserver3d/ directory manually (again).

cheers
Joschka (for the maintenance comittee)

we have just released rcssserver3D-0.5.2. 

rcssserver3D is a multi-agent simulation system for physical agents in
three-dimensional environments. It features a flexible application
framework and a scene description language for setting up different
kinds of simulations. The soccer simulation built on top of this will
be used for the 3D Simulation League competition on RoboCup 2006 
(see http://www.robocup2006.org/).

Important fixes and new features:

- More fixes for problems in the offside code, the agent communication, the
  kick effector, and the pan/tilt effector that moves the agent's camera.

- compile fixes for gcc 4.1.

- several improvements to the handling of the monitor for visualization of the
  simulation. 

- some parameter changes to fix the settings for the competition at RoboCup-2006.

For details have a look into the ChangeLog coming with the package.

You can get the package on the Soccer Simulator page on SourceForge
at http://sourceforge.net/projects/sserver/

cheers
Joschka Boedecker
