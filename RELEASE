We have just released version 0.5.4 of rcssserver3D. This release
contains fixes for known problems (e.g. in the visionperceptor or the
spark sample agent), updates of old plug-ins for the new simulation
(beameffector, initeffector), and new features like a log player, and
new perceptors. 

* Important fixes:

visionperceptor: 
- patch (vision6) by Yuan to fix problems related to the local 
  reference frame of the robot

soccerbot:
- anchor of the ankle joint was set higher to avoid foot penetration
  when doing large steps (thanks Guangbin Cui)

beameffector:
- all the bodies below the parent of the effector are moved now 
  instead of only one (thanks Amin)

initeffector:
- move all the bodies below the parent of the effector to the initial position

simspark:
- increased goal height
- reduced ball size and mass
- internal rendering can be switched off without affecting timing now
- support for ODE collision spaces was implemented by Markus
- a 64-Bit compile issue was fixed (thanks Sander van Dijk)

agentspark:
- patch by snow to fix problems in the GetMessage function
- sending init message in the SoccerBotBehavior

* Features:

- simspark now uses the new SingleMatInitEffector to initialize 
  agents based on their teamname (different initial position and 
  different uniform color)
- simspark can record logfiles (thanks Hesham & Amin)
- monitorspark can playback the recorded logfiles (thanks Hesham & Amin)
- new gyro rate perceptor (thanks Hedayat)
- new binary touch sensor

You can find the package at the usual place [1].

Please note that you should update the rcssserver3D.rb file in your
~/.rcssserver3d/ directory manually (again).

Cheers
Joschka (for the maintenance comittee)

** [General (SF Project News etc)]

We have just released rcssserver3D-0.5.4. 

rcssserver3D is a multi-agent simulation system for physical agents in
three-dimensional environments. It features a flexible application
framework and a scene description language for setting up different
kinds of simulations. The soccer simulation built on top of this is used
in the RoboCup 3D Soccer Simulation League.

Important fixes and new features:

- issues concerning the local reference frame of the robot's vision
  perceptor have been fixed

- issues in the sample agent concerning message retrieval from the
  network socket have been fixed

- several effectors have been updated to be compatible with the new
  simspark simulation

- new perceptors have been implemented (gyro rate, touch)

- log file recording & playback was implemented 

For details have a look into the ChangeLog coming with the package.

You can get the package on the Soccer Simulator page on SourceForge
at http://sourceforge.net/projects/sserver/

Cheers
Joschka Boedecker
