 We have just released rcssserver3d-0.5.7. This is the first release
 after the competition in Atlanta. The simulator now contains the
 auto-adjust speed mode(by default),the server will run slower when
 needed, and print warning. We also applied changes what be made in
 Atlanta, and re-enabled the communication between robots.
 Furthermore, we imported some new features from SimSpark Project,
 including rsgedit, rosimporter, and etc. Although they are optional,
 you may want to try the rsgedit, please install the wxWidgets[1]
 firstly and take a look at the 'Quick start to RsgEdit' in the doc
 directory. Finally, there is a new robot model which is built with
 composite bodies for better performance. The monitor logger was also
 bug-fixed and improved. With the help of the community, the documents
 about the server are available now, but they are still in progress.

* Documents:
 - the user's manual in doc/users
 - the server developer's manual in doc/devel
 - there are also some useful information at SimSpark Wiki[1]

* Important fixes:
 - mointor logger:
  - fixed methods to work properly.
  - solve the update problem (reported by team Apollo).
  - remove invisible nodes to save  bandwidth(thanks to Carlos
    Bustamante from Borregos3D).

* Features:
- applied Atlanta 2007 server changes:
               - 'm' and 'c' for killing agents
               - two robot models with different facilities
               - using materials with textures
               - free kick distance changed to 4.5
               - one half time (8 mins)
               - agents can beam in Goal_Left or Goal_Right play modes
               - no longer possible to move agents by pressing m
- re-enabled communication, the soccerbot056 has SayEffector and
 HearPerceptor
- add AdjustSpeed mode (It is enabled by default). In this mode, the
 server will run slower when needed.
- new multi-threaded implementation
- rosimporter, model importer for RoSiML[2] modeling language
- rsgedit, a cool simspark simulator with graphic user interface.
- soccerbotcomp, the new robot mode which is built with composite
 bodies, it can advance the simulation speed.
- include some useful utilities: tinyxml, wxflatnotebook and wxscintilla

For details have a look into the ChangeLog coming with the package.

We have just released rcssserver3d-0.5.7. 

rcssserver3D is a multi-agent simulation system for physical agents in
three-dimensional environments. It features a flexible application
framework and a scene description language for setting up different
kinds of simulations. The soccer simulation built on top of this is used
in the RoboCup 3D Soccer Simulation League.
