Dear all,

we have just released rcssserver3D-0.3. 

rcssserver3D is a multi-agent simulation system for physical agents in
three-dimensional environments. It features a flexible application
framework and a scene description language for setting up different
kinds of simulations. The soccer simulation built on top of this will
be used for the 3D Simulation League competition on RoboCup 2004 [1].

In this release, a few bugs have been fixed and the soccer rules have
been polished for the competition. In the soccer simulation, the ball
is dropped when no player goes to the ball; it is also possible to
drop the ball manually now. The match length has been extended to 2*
5 minutes.

For details have a look into the ChangeLog.

You can get the package on the Soccer Simulator page on SourceForge [2].

cheers
Oliver Obst
