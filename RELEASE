we have just released version 0.5.1 of rcssserver3D. This release
fixes mainly two problems:

- Offside Rules. We received a patch from the Virtual Werder Team
  (Arne Stahlbock et.al.) containing some fixes for the offside 
  implementation. The Source package contains also a file README-soccer
  with some observations/explanations. 

- The new RestrictedVisionPerceptor (RVP) was hardly useable, so we
  fixed the vision by making it static (and not dependend on how the
  spheres are rolling). A new PanTilt Effector can be used to change
  the view direction. With a static percept, the RVP sees only objects 
  in the view cone (it does not see flags outside the view cone).

You can find the package at the usual place [1]. In addition to the
full source package, we created a binary rpm (built on SuSE 10), and a
source patch. If you installed the 0.5 version from source, the patch
can be applied to your sources and hopefully helps to save compilation
time. 

Please note that you should update the rcssserver3D.rb file in your
~/.rcssserver3d/ directory manually (again).

cheers
Oliver (for the maintenance comittee)

P.S.: Please note that using Ruby 1.8.4 causes problems with our simulator
      (this problem was identified thanks to Daniel Hein and Markus Rollmann)

we have just released rcssserver3D-0.5.1. 

rcssserver3D is a multi-agent simulation system for physical agents in
three-dimensional environments. It features a flexible application
framework and a scene description language for setting up different
kinds of simulations. The soccer simulation built on top of this will
be used for the 3D Simulation League competition on RoboCup 2006 
(see http://www.robocup2006.org/).

Important fixes and new features:

- The Offside Rules were fixed.

- The new RestrictedVisionPerceptor (RVP) was hardly useable, so we
  fixed the vision by making it static (and not dependend on how the
  spheres are rolling). A new PanTilt Effector can be used to change
  the view direction. With a static percept, the RVP sees only objects 
  in the view cone (it does not see flags outside the view cone).

For details have a look into the ChangeLog coming with the package.

You can get the package on the Soccer Simulator page on SourceForge
at http://sourceforge.net/projects/sserver/
