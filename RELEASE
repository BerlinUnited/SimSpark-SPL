Hi all,

we have just released a new version of rcssserver3D. For this second
release, we implemented an important part of the soccer specific
plugins for a soccer simulation for RoboCup Simulation league. It is
possible to create a team of soccer playing robots that can drive
around and kick the ball, score goals, and things like that.  
The work on the soccer rules (or on the referee, so to say) is still
not completely finished, but the very basic things are running.

Just to give an impression -- so that you are not disappointed
afterwards :) : with respect to the soccer rules just 
compare the 3D simulator you can expect this year with the 2D 
simulator of 1997. (maybe have a look at the final matches 
logfiles ;-) - but this is just a beginning.

All the effectors and perceptors of the simulated robots have some
parameters which are basically untested and more or less randomly
chosen. So this second release serves two purposes: You need to
program a simple team for this simulator in order to qualify for
participation in RC2004. The second purpose of this release is that we
would like to get feedback on parameter settings, the bugs you will
probably find, or anything else you want to say about the
simulator. Please send the emails to the soccer simulator mailing
list, so we can discuss about new features or requests for changes.

For RoboCup 2004, we are planning to use rcssserver3D-0.3.x, which will 
not be released before the qualification notification. Until then, we 
may be releasing bug fixes for this version of rcssserver3D. 
Changes to come in the 0.3 release are a more complete set of soccer 
rules; currently there are no plans for big changes in moving the 
agents or kicking the ball -- unless the discussion reveals new
insights. 

To create new soccer clients, you need to create agents compatible
with SPADES. You can get extensive documentation together with the
SPADES library [1]. We also included a primitive agent that
drives towards the ball and kicks from time to time.

Because there were a lot of requests for a manual: We have added a
small text describing some of the features of the simulated
robots. This is still not a comprehensive manual, but unless someone
is volunteering to write one...

You can get the package on the Soccer Simulator page on SourceForge [2].

So much for now
best wishes
