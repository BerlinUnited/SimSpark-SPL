We have just released version 0.5.5 of rcssserver3D. The simulator has
been ported to MacOS, the network messages were shortened, we did some
performance tuning, improved the log player, added a new perceptor,
and fixed some bugs.

* Important fixes:

simspark: 
- fixed setup of goal flags (thanks Carlos) 
- several files were missing break statments in the physicsserver
  directory (thanks Shivaram)

gyrorateperceptor:
- "rt" keyword was added to enable correct parsing of the perceptor
  values

* Features:

- MacOS compatibility (please see README.MacOS file for comments)
- individual ODE CollisionSpaces are used to encapsulate each agent and 
  each goal now
- the protocols for the monitor and the agents have been shortened
- new basic importer for Wavefront OBJ files
- textures can be enabled for the ball, the field, and the agent torso
  (player numbers :-) )
- several computationally expensive function calls have been replaced
  with calls to more efficient versions
- the log player now plays logfiles in forward and backward mode, and 
  supports pause, and forward/backward stepping
- a new perceptor (ForceResistancePerceptor) was implemented that gives 
  feedback about position and resulting force due to a collision of the 
  body the perceptor is attached to (see doc/TEXT_INSTEAD_OF_A_MANUAL.txt 
  for details)
- BeamEffector now takes 3 arguments: position (x and y) and angle in the
  x-y-plane (rotation around z-axis) at the beam position (DEG)

You can find the package at the usual place [1]. 

Please note that you will also need an additional package containing
data files (models, textures) that is available at the same
location. This package should be extracted in the installation
directory of rcssserver3D (/usr/local/share/rcssserver3d if the
default prefix has not been changed).

Cheers
Joschka (for the maintenance comittee)

** [General (SF Project News etc)]

We have just released rcssserver3D-0.5.5. 

rcssserver3D is a multi-agent simulation system for physical agents in
three-dimensional environments. It features a flexible application
framework and a scene description language for setting up different
kinds of simulations. The soccer simulation built on top of this is used
in the RoboCup 3D Soccer Simulation League.

Important fixes and new features:

- MacOS port has been completed

- individual ODE CollisionSpaces are used to encapsulate each agent and 
  each goal now

- the protocols for the monitor and the agents have been shortened

- new basic importer for Wavefront OBJ files

- textures can be enabled for the ball, the field, and the agent torso
  (player numbers :-) )

- overall performance has been increased

- the log player now plays logfiles in forward and backward mode, and 
  supports pause, and forward/backward stepping

- a new perceptor (ForceResistancePerceptor) was implemented that gives 
  feedback about position and resulting force due to a collision of the 
  body the perceptor is attached to

- BeamEffector now takes 3 arguments: position (x and y) and angle in the
  x-y-plane (rotation around z-axis) at the beam position (DEG)

For details have a look into the ChangeLog coming with the package.

You can get the package on the Soccer Simulator page on SourceForge
at http://sourceforge.net/projects/sserver/
