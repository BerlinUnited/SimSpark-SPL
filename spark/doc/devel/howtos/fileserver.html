<p align="left"><font size="4">The FileServer manages a series of FileSystems. 
  When a file is opened through the FileServer it searches its internal list of 
  FileSystems and returns the first(!) successful fileopen attempt. A virtually 
  unlimited amount of file systems can be added. FileSystems are created through 
  the class object mechanism. In order to mount a file system, one must specify 
  the FileSystem class and an associated path string. How this path string is 
  interpreted is up to the implementation of the FileSystem. For example, the 
  FileSystemSTD implementation (see Plugins workspace) interprets the path as 
  a regular directory path, whereas the FileSystemZIP implementation interprets 
  it as the location of a ZIP file.</font></p>
