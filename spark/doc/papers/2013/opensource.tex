\section{Introduction}
The development on robots may be severely limited by the constrained resources.
This is especially true in the research of multi-robot systems in areas such as RoboCup.
Using simulation for algorithm development and testing makes thing easier.

% \paragraph{History}
SimSpark, a multi-robot simulator based on the generic components of the Spark\cite{OR05} physical multi-agent simulation system, has been used in the RoboCup Soccer Simulation League since 2004.
The project was registered as open source project in SourceForge in 2004, it has an established code base with development increasing year-over-year.
As the result, RoboCup soccer simulations have changed significantly over the years, going from rather abstract agent representations to more and more realistic humanoid robot games\cite{Boedecker2008,usermanual}.
Thanks to the flexibility of the Spark system, these transitions were achieved with little changes to the simulator's core architecture.

In this paper we describe the recent development of SimSpark project, which make the SimSpark possible to simulate 11 vs. 11 humanoid robot soccer games in real time.
In section \ref{s:overview}, we will give an overview of the SimSpark project since 2008. After that, we will describe the development of the Spark simulation platform in section \ref{s:spark} and the implementation of RoboCup 3D Soccer Simulator in section \ref{s:rcssserver3d}.
We will introduce some new features for RoboCup 2013 in section \ref{s:ongoing}.
Furthermore, we will give the application examples of SimSpark in section \ref{s:application}.
Finally, we will outline future development plans in section \ref{s:conclusion}.

\review{As a technical paper, it is better to add detailed description of the mechanism to guarantee the generality and the extendability of SimSpark.}

\section{Project Overview}
\label{s:overview}

Until 2008, soccer simulation and SimSpark simulator were developed and released as a single project called rcssserver3d.
In late 2008, the SimSpark project migrated from CVS repository at \url{http://sserver.sourceforge.net} to the new project Subversion repository at 
\url{http://simspark.sourceforge.net}. As part of this process, the project was broken
to two main projects (Spark simulation platform and RCSSServer3D soccer simulation server) 
and two auxiliary projects (RSGEdit and simspark-utilities).
The separation clarifies SimSpark is a generic simulation environment rather than only a robot soccer simulator.

SimSpark was never a single-platform project, but it practically didn't support 
Windows. In recent years, Windows support was added after migration from Autotools
to CMake, and windows installers are now released. 

\section{Spark}
\label{s:spark}

\review{a picture of the architecture would simplify reading may be including clients and monitor}

As a generic simulation environment, Spark provides a rich set of features to create, debug and modify multi-robot simulations.
It has three main components, including the simulation engine, the object and memory management system, and the physics engine. Details about architecture and concepts of Spark have been described in \cite{Boedecker2008,OR05}.
In this section, we describe the necessary changes for simulating 11 vs. 11 humanoid robot soccer game.
However changes to the simulator core were never specialized for the soccer simulation.
% First, a set of sensors of humanoid robot are implemented as plugins. Second, multi-threads supporting takes advantage of multi-cores in modern CPU to be able to run in real time.

\paragraph{Sensor Plugins}
Sensors of a robot allows awareness of the robot's state and the environment.
Humanoid robots like the NAO usually have many different sensors installed.
We have implemented new plugins to simulate sensors of humanoid robots.
Some of the sensors delivers information from physics engine, such as joint position, gyro, accelerometer, and force resistance. Furthermore, lines can be sensed by virtual vision.
Additionally, a more realistic camera which delivers images rendered via OpenGL hardware accelerated offscreen buffers is implemented. Details of these sensors can be found in \cite{usermanual}.

\paragraph{Multi-threads Supporting}
% In modern time, computers have a processor with multi-cores or even multi-CPUs.
% This improves the performance greatly, but only the multi-threaded program can benefit.
One great feature of SimSpark is switching between single thread mode and multi-threads
mode. The multi-threads mode can improve the performance in computer with multi-cores processor, but the single thread mode is also useful for developing the simulator. 

The implementation of multi-threads loop is based on two conditions.
First, different tasks are assigned to different \textit{SimControlNode}s in SimSpark.
For example, \textit{AgentControl} is a node that manages the communication with agents.
For each simulation cycle, \textit{SimControlNode}s are executed one by one in the single thread mode, but they can run in parallel.
Second, all data of simulation state is stored in a tree called \textit{active scene},
the physics engine and \textit{SimControlNode}s interact through the \textit{active scene}.
As we know, the physics computation is the most time-consuming, and the physics engine does not need to access the active scene during physics computation.
So the physics computation and \textit{SimControlNode}s can run in parallel.
Furthermore, the physics engine, e.g. Open Dynamic Engine\cite{Smith:ODE}, is modified to run in parallel by using Intel Threading Building Blocks\cite{tbb}.

In RoboCup 2012, the 11 vs. 11 humanoid robot (22 degree of freedom) soccer games were simulated in real time by computer with Intel Core i7-975 @3.33GHz CPU and 4G DDR3 RAM.

\review{22 agents is great. Just to add that in such a setup, the soccerserver claims 'only' 160\% of an 800\% CPU availability even when run in as fast as possible mode. So there still might be space for improvement.}

\review{it is nice to add some comparative evaluation of speed up by multi-threading.}

\todo[color=yellow]{results of performance improvement, any benchmark?}

\section{RCSSServer3D}
\label{s:rcssserver3d}

As the competition environment for the Soccer Simulation 3D League at RoboCup, 
RCSSServer3D simulates the soccer field where two team of robots play soccer game.
In its initial version players were modeled as spheres in a physical three dimensional world. Now it supports humanoid players with articulated bodies.
% In particular,  the soccer environment and rules are implemented in the simulation, and the NAO robot manufactured by Aldebaran Robotics is modeled.

\paragraph{Soccer Simulation}
Most rules of the soccer game are judged by an automatic rule set that enforces the basic soccer rule set.
However more involved situations like detection unfair behavior still require a human referee.
Noticeably, the size of soccer field is increasing every year, since the number of robots in each team is increasing. In RoboCup 2012, each team has 11 robots.
This makes coordination between multi-robots more important.

\paragraph{Robot Model}
The NAO robot is currently used in the competitions of the Soccer Simulation 3D League at RoboCup. Its height is about 57cm and its weight is around 4.5kg.
Its biped architecture with 22 degrees of freedom allows NAO to have great mobility.
The NAO robot model is also equipped with a powerful selection of the
sensors described in section \ref{s:spark}, to provide a widespread information base for
agent development.
There are differences between simulated NAO and real NAO. For example, the hip joints are physically connected by one motor in the real NAO. Furthermore, the simulated robot gets positions of objects via virtual vision sensor, while the real robot has to process images to understand the world. Nevertheless, this NAO model enables RCSSServer3D to be a good humanoid robot research platform.


\section{Experimental Features}
\label{s:ongoing}

For getting more realistic simulation, some new features are proposed and implemented, including realistic motor, heterogeneous robots, and agent proxies.
% Furthermore, a new graphic user interface is implemented for better user experiences.
These experimental features probably will be used in RoboCup 2013 for the first time.

\subsection{Realistic Motor}
NAO robot has twenty-one motor joints as its actuators.
The simulation engine, i.e. ODE, provides a simple model of real life servos:
the motor brings the body up to speed in one step; and provides force that is not more than is allowed.
The simple motor model is one reason for the unrealistic simulation results.
% Furthermore, some aspects like stiffness control, power consumption and temperature regulation, are missing but are also important for robotics.
In this section, we proposed and implemented a realistic motor model. More details and experimental results are described in \cite{Xu2012}.

\paragraph{Stiffness}
The stiffness determines how strong the motor is.
% The value is from 0.0 to 1.0, 0 means the motor is off and 1 means the motor is running at full power. 
In the real robot, this percentage is the maximum electric current applied to the motor.
% Setting the stiffness to 0.5 means that the electric current limitation is reduced to 50\%.
For a DC motor, the electric current, $I$, determines the output torque,
$\tau = K_\tau I \label{eq:tau-i}$;
where $K_\tau$ is the torque constant of the motor, and can be found in the
specification.
The simulation engine can specify the maximum torque of the servo, therefore the
stiffness control can be easily implemented by setting the maximum torque
of the simulated servo:
\begin{align}
  \tau_{max}(t) &= k_{s}(t) T_{max}
\end{align}
where $\tau_{max}(t)$ is the maximum torque set in the simulated servo at
time $t$; $k_{s}(t)$ is the stiffness at time $t$; and $T_{max}$
denotes the maximum torque of the servo when stiffness is 1.

\paragraph{Power Consumption}
Another important aspect of real motor is power consumption.
Because the robot is powered by a battery with limited energy, and has to walk during the
game.
Furthermore, the motor can overheat if it consumes too much energy and becomes too hot.
In real robots, the temperature of each motor is measured, and the motor shuts down 
when the temperature is too high.

DC motors can be modeled by the following equation:
$U = U_e + IR \label{eq:u-ir} = K_e \dot{\theta} \label{eq:u-ke}$;
where $U$ is the voltage of input, $U_e$ is the back electromotive
force (EMF), $I$ is the electric current, $R$ is resistance,
$\dot{\theta}$ is the speed, and $K_e$ is the speed constant of the motor.
The value of $R$ and $K_e$ can be found in the specifications of motor again;
and the simulation engine provides
the value of $\tau$ and $\dot{\theta}$; therefore we can calculate the
power consumption:
\begin{align}
  P = UI = U_eI + I^2R = \frac{K_e}{K_\tau}\dot{\theta}\tau + \frac{R}{K_\tau^2}\tau^2
\end{align}
And the total energy used by the motor is:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:motor-power}
  E = \sum_t{P_t\Delta{}t}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta{}t$ is the time step of the simulation, and $P_t$ is the power consumed at time $t$. For the overall
power consumption, the energy consumed by devices other than motors,
e.g. main board, CPU, camera, etc. has to be counted.
% \Cref{fig:battery} compares the simulation result of this model to
% reality.

%     }
%     \label{fig:joint-temperature}
%   \end{minipage}
% \end{figure}

\paragraph{Temperature Regulation}
We model the temperature and heat of the motor with the following equations:
\begin{align}
  \Delta{}Q &= \Delta{}Q^+ + \Delta{}Q^- = I^2R\Delta{}t -\lambda(T-T_e)\Delta{}t \\
  \Delta{}Q &= C\Delta{}T
\end{align}
where $T$ is the temperature of the motor, $T_e$
is the environment temperature inside the motor, so it is higher than outside and differs from motor to motor, $\Delta{}Q$ is the
heat changing, $\Delta{}Q^+$ is the heat produced by the motor, $\Delta{}Q^-$ is
the heat transferred from the motor to the environment,  $\lambda$ is thermal conductivity which indicates the ability of a motor to conduct heat, and $C$ is the heat capacity of
the motor, which can be seen as constant. Finally, the temperature of
the motor at time $t+\Delta{}t$ can be solved as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:motor-temp}
  T_{t+\Delta{}t} = T_t + \Delta{}T = T_t + \frac{[I^2R-\lambda(T_t-T_e)]\Delta{}t}{C}
\end{equation}
In this model, we need to determine $T_e$, $\lambda$, and $C$ by experiments.
% It can be formulate as a classic linear regression problem.
A sequence values of $\Delta{}t$, $T_t$, and $I^2R$ can be measured by experiment, therefore the optimum parameters of \cref{eq:motor-temp} is determined.
% After determining the parameters in the \cref{eq:motor-temp}, we can use this model to simulate motor temperature.
% In \Cref{fig:joint-temperature}, the simulated temperature is compared with data from the real robot.

The whole process of joint simulation is summarized in
\Cref{fig:joint}.
% stiffness $k_s$ is simulated by setting the maximum torque
% of the motor $\tau_{max}$; the final maximum torque $\tau_m$ used by simulation engine is calculated by temperature regulation; and the simulation engine computes the resulted angle
% and torque applied; in the end, the consumed power and temperature are
% computed by \cref{eq:motor-power,eq:motor-temp} respectively. 
When the battery is empty, the maximum torque $\tau_{max}$ is set to 0 to turn off the motor.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Heterogeneous Robots}
Heterogeneous systems are emerging as effective solutions to many multi-robot tasks,
it is also true for the soccer team. The physical difference between robots are important when they serve diverse roles in a cooperating team.
In simulation, the physical properties of the robot can be easily changed, so it is a good platform for researching on heterogeneous systems.

Heterogeneity also creates new challenges for robot AI developers.
The robots with different mechanical properties will be generated at running time,
different robots are provided to teams, so teams have to adopt their developed behaviors to unknown robots.

SimSpark already provided the ability to define different robot models and 
use them in its simulation environment. However, each model was fixed and if you
wanted to have several variations of a robot, you had to defined several 
separate robot models. To better support games with heterogeneous robots, we have
implemented the parametric robot model. 
This model has a number of parameters and can have different values for different robot variations. For example, the length of the legs can be different for different robots.
In order to launch this model, only these parameters have to be specified additionally.

\subsection{Agent Proxies}
Initially, SimSpark used SPADES\cite{riley2003spades} for managing external agents. It
managed the simulation time and the time spend in agents for thinking. Later it was
dropped because of its complexities and agents communicated with the server directly.
The cycle duration was managed by the server without considering agents and the network
latency. Therefore, if agents were unable to deliver their commands to the server in a
cycle because of network latency, their commands were executed by the simulator
in the next simulation cycle. As the number of soccer players in soccer simulation 
increased, this problem became more apparent.

To solve this problem, the concept of agent proxies was proposed.
Agents communicate with the proxies instead of 
communicating directly with the simulator. In this model, the cycle time is managed
by the proxies on the client side, and they communicate with the simulator in Sync Mode.
Therefore, the simulator waits for all proxies to signal the end of a cycle and 
then proceeds with the next cycle. This model ensures that agents can use the allowed
cycle time to think in a cycle when new information is delivered to them. 

This model is not perfect because the agents can have some spare time if network latency
occurs, but it is more predictable and fairer than the old model.
The network latency can be reduced by using binary network protocol between proxies and simulator.
Nevertheless, no new information is arrived to agents in that spare time and they cannot send new 
commands for that cycle.

Currently, an initial version of agent proxies is under development outside SimSpark
project using Java.

% \subsection{SimSpark GUI}
% \todo{SimSpark GUI: \url{http://simspark.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Graphical_User_Interface}}

% NOTE: It will be merged to trunk soon. So it is almost complete.

% The main goal of this project is to provide a flexible and extensible User Interface and Simulation Development Environment, that can be used to start, control and monitor different simulations using the Simspark server, agent and monitor processes, as well as incorporate several additional tools like for example a visual editor for robot models (like RsgEdit) or a debugging monitor for agents (like RoboViz). 

\section{Applications}
In addition to be used in RoboCup Soccer Simulation 3D League, SimSpark is gaining popularity in other leagues, including Standard Platform League and Humanoid League. It is also widely used to teach artificial intelligence and robotic lectures.

\label{s:application}
\paragraph{RoboCup Soccer Simulation 3D League} Since 2004, SimSpark has been used as a official competitions environment. Research teams have developed useful research tools based on SimSpark.
For example, RoboViz\cite{Stoecker2012} is designed to assess and develop agent behaviors in SimSpark. And these tools are also released in open source.
Combined with these tools, SimSpark becomes a featured platform to develop and test new algorithms for multi-robot systems.

\paragraph{RoboCup Soccer Standard Platform League}
% As one of the long term goals of the soccer simulation is to aim for realism the long term objective are realistic humanoid players in a physical environment.
% These players should one day challenge the champion of the most recent World Cup.
% The SimSpark is also used by teams in RoboCup Standard Platform League and Humanoid League.

The special situation between Standard Platform League and 3D Simulation League is that both leagues use the same robot model ‚Äî NAO from Aldebaran.
So it appears to be natural to reuse the work which has already been done.
Nao Team Humboldt developed a software architecture\cite{SCPR2010} which enables their control software can run both in real NAO and simulated NAO with SimSpark. This helps them to participate in both Simulation League and Standard Platform League, and achieve some good results.
Furthermore, they also promotes the usage of SimSpark in the Standard Platform League by implementing its rules, see \Cref{f:simspark-spl}.

\begin{figure}

  \caption{Prototype of the extended SimSpark for Standard Platform League.
    The bottom of screen are images of robot cameras.}
  \label{f:simspark-spl}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{RoboCup Soccer Humanoid League}
Of course the simulator can also be extended for other leagues by adding new robot models.
For example, in RoboCup Humanoid Kid Size League, FUmanoid\cite{Donat2012} uses
SimSpark to perform multi-level testing methods for archiving higher
quality in each module of their robot control software and unlink the
module test from the robotic hardware.


\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{s:conclusion}
SimSpark is a powerful tool to state different multi-robot researches.
The introduction of a humanoid robot model increase the realism of SimSpark, and gains popularity in research teams who have real robots.
The increased number of players per team makes research slowly get back to the high level behaviors based on solid low level behavior for realistic humanoid robot teams.

SimSpark has undergone continuous development driven by the requirement of continuous research in multi-robot system. The following extentions are planned:
\begin{description}
\item[Integration With Existing Robotic Frameworks] 
To enhance the usability of SimSpark for wider usage, and also to make it easier to develop and test their robotic software on SimSpark and to
use the same code on real hardware, we aim to integrate SimSpark to an 
existing robotic framework, such as ROS or Player.

% Player is a well-known robotic framework which
% can be used to control both real and simulated robots. We planned to integrate
% SimSpark with Player so that people can develop agents for SimSpark using 
% Player interfaces. It has the additional benefit of using Player's network
% protocol which is much more efficient than the current network protocol used
% in SimSpark. It is also a good opportunity to enhance the multi-threaded 
% capabilities of SimSpark given the asynchronous nature of using Player with
% different robot sensors. 

% Recently, another robotic framework called ROS is gaining popularity and is in
% active development. Therefore, we will reconsider our planning and might decide
% to integrate SimSpark with ROS instead. However, considering that Player itself
% is integrated into ROS, integrating with Player still might make sense. 

% If SimSpark is integrated into an existing robotic framework, it is possible 
% for researchers to develop a single program to control both a simulated 
% robot inside and the same real robot given that the robot itself is also
% supported by the framework. It will be also much easier to attract people 
% who have developed programs for real robots using the framework to experiment
% with SimSpark.

\item[Physics Abstraction Layer]
Relying on a single physics engine, i.e. ODE, hampers Simspark's flexibility.
Thus, the physics abstraction layer has be developed\cite{Held2010}, ODE and Bullet can be used as plugins of SimSpark. However, current implementation has many drawbacks and difficult to maintenance.
% \review{any plans to support physics calculations in GPU? Or is it done already? -- it should be the task of physics engine}

\item[Robot Model Importers]
The usage of SimSpark will be extended when it has more robot models, however creating robot models is a time consuming task. The idea is to create model importers for different model format, so SimSpark will be able to use the robot model which is available in other simulators.
