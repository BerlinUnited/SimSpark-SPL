  abstract = {We describe a new multi-agent simulation system, called Spark, for
	agents in three-dimensional environments. Our goal in creating Spark
	was to provide a high degree of flexibility for creating new types
	of simulations. We implemented a flexible application framework and
	exhausted the idea of replaceable components in the resulting system.
	In comparison to specialized simulators, users can effortlessly create
	new simulations by using a scene description language. Spark is a
	powerful tool to state description language. Spark is a powerful
	tool to state used as official simulator for the first three-dimensional
	RoboCup Simulation League competition. }
