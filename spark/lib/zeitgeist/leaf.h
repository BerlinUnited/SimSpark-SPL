        HISTORY:
                04.06.2002 MK
                        - initial version
                13.06.2002 MK
                        - reworked Base to use a quad-linked tree
                15.06.2002 MK
                        - split Base up into Base and Node classes
                02.09.2002 MK
                        - removed quad-link
                22.02.2003 MK
                        - renamed to Leaf
