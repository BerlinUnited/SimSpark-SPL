/** \class Collider encapsulates a geometry object- geom for
    short. Geoms are the fundamental objects in the collision
    system. They represent a single rigid shape as for example a
    sphere or a box. A special kind of geom called 'space' can
    represent a group of other geoms. A placeable geom can be
    associated with rigid body objects. This allows the collision
    engine to get the position and orientation of the geoms from the
    bodies. A body and a geom together represent all the properties of
    the simulated object.
