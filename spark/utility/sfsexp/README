Code in this directory is taken from the sfsexp library, a GPL'ed project 
hosted on SF (www.sf.net/projects/sexp/).

Below is the README from the original distribution (sexp 0.3.2).

1. BUILDING

First, you need to run autoconf.

	% ./configure

To build, do this:

	% make

What comes out is a library called "libsexpr.a".  That's it.  It may
be possible that whatever platform you're on may link libraries in a
weird way, so you might have to tweak the makefile.

Successfully tested under:
   RedHat Linux (Intel and Alpha), MacOS X 10.1.x and 10.2

Should work on:
   Anything with a standard C compiler

If you look at the makefiles, you'll see a couple of additional build
targets -- debug and mallocdebug.  Debug turns on anything hiding in
#ifdef _DEBUG_ blocks, and mallocdebug does the same for 
#ifdef _DEBUG_MALLOCS_ blocks.  Both turn on the -g option so GDB can
be used to debug things, and malloc debugging enables Erik Hendriks'
wonderful malloc debugging library.  Very useful to use when developing
codes that use this library when there is a suspected memory issue somewhere
related to this code.

If you want the docs, make sure you have doxygen installed and that the
DOXYGEN variable in the Makefile.in in this directory points at the right
place.  Rerun autoconf to regenerate the makefiles, and then type:

	% make doc

If all is well, you should get documentation.  If not, try running it by hand.
If that still fails, just use the docs from the web.  The documentation here
changes so infrequently that users generating it themselves is not a huge
concern on my end.

2. USING

In any code that wants to use this, just include "sexpr.h".  That contains
the one data structure, enumeration, and five functions for manipulating
and parsing strings and s-expressions.  To compile, just do something like
this:

	% cc -I/path/to/sexpr/include -L/path/to/sexpr/library \
		-o foo  foo.o -lsexpr

3. MORE INFO

For additions, bug fixes, complaints, etc., email : matt@lanl.gov
For legal mumbo-jumbo, look "NOTICES" in this directory.  
Supposedly memory leaks have been patched.  Let me know if any new ones pop
up.  (Note: programmer is responsible for calling destroy_sexp when they're
done with one - not my fault if they don't.)

4. SMALLER?

It's shorter than a few similar libraries I found on the net that were
IMHO, excessively complex and difficult to understant.  An s-expression
is composed of atoms, or other s-expressions - period.  How people can
turn that into a complicated mess is BEYOND me...

5. CREDITS

The library is by Matt Sottile.  Steve James of Linux Labs has
contributed bug fixes and features while developing for the related
Supermon project.  Sung-Eun Choi and Paul Ruth have been the most active
users and have contributed many bug reports as the library has grown.
Erik Hendriks contributed the malloc debugging tools now used when
building with the -D_DEBUG_MALLOCS_ option.
