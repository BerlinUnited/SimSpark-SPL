[0.3.2]
Simspark 0.3.2 is ready. It contains a fix for exploding agents.

 - By not allowing the effector to be used when the angle is already outside of its range, 
   the toe exploding problem seems to be largely reduced if not eliminated.

You can get the package on the Simspark page on Gitlab
at https://robocup-sim.gitlab.io/SimSpark/
