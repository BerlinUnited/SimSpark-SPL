RELEASE News of simspark-0.1.3 (in progress)

SOME INTERESTING COMMENTS!

Main changes of this release are:
 - Compilation fixes
 - Improved Windows support
 - Simspark should always accept connections. No more "Connection refused"
   messages and the need to wait for simspark's network port to be freed!
 - Simspark will now collect received commands right before sending
   sense data of the last cycle. So, any commands which is sent by agents
   after receiving new sense data will be executed in the next cycle, not the 
   current one. This results in a more deterministic behavior, and agents' 
   efficiency should not change between remote and local runs considerably.   

You can get the package on the Simspark page on SourceForge
