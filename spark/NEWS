[0.1.2]
This release brings some bugfixes, better performance and also better Windows
support. A Windows installer will be available too. This is the first version 
which runs in multi-threaded mode by default. The multi-threaded mode is still
in early stages, and it can be improved cosiderably in future.

Main changes of this release are:
 - improved Windows support, including Windows Installer. 
 - Multi-threaded mode now works, and is the default mode when running simspark
 - Performance improvements
 - Fixed a bug in networking code, which were introduced in 0.1.1

[0.1.1]
This release is mainly a bug-fix release, and is the last release before
RoboCup 2009 competitions. It is not much different from version 0.1.
Main changes are:
 - improved MacOSX and Windows support
 - compilation fixes for latest library versions
 - more reliable and a bit more fair network communication with the agents

[0.1]
This is the first release of the simulator after RoboCup 2008 competitions,
and the first release of simspark core simulation package as a separate
package.
In this release, MaxStepsPerCycle have been reduced to 1, so the simulation
time spent in each cycle is fixed. As a result, the performance of the agents
should not depend on the simulator speed, and they should be able to sense/act
in fixed simulation time steps.
This package provides a generic simulation framework and does not contain any
soccer features. To use the soccer simulator, you should install rcssserver3d
package which depends on this package. 
Also, we do not use autotools for our build system anymore. You should use
CMake (version 2.6) to build the package. See INSTALL for further installation
instructions.
