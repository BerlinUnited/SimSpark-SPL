Installation Instructions
==========================
You can build this package using CMake build system (version 2.6 or higher
should be installed on your system). CMake can generate different kinds of
native build files for your system (e.g. Unix Makefiles, Eclipse CDT 4.0 project
files, Visual Studio project files). You can generate build files using CMake
command-line or GUI interfaces.

Requirements
============
CMake version 2.6 or higher
Ruby 1.8
Boost C++ Libraries
Open Dynamics Engine (ODE)
FreeType
Developer Image Library (DevIL)
OpenGL
SDL

The following packages are optional:
wxWidgets: for inputwx plugin (e.g. required if you want to build rsgedit)
FMOD: to buid fmod sound system plugin
Latex (pdflatex): to generate developers manual
Doxygen: to generate API documentation


Basic Installation Using CMake Command-line Interface
=====================================================
1. Unpack the distribution and change directory to the top level source tree.
2. (Recommended) Create a directory to hold your build files (e.g. 'mkdir build')
3. Change directory to the directory you created in the previous step (for the
above example, you can use 'cd build')
4. Run 'cmake ..' to configure the package and generate build files. On Linux,
it'll generate Makefiles for the package
5. Optionally, you can run 'ccmake .' to edit the build settings (for example
the installation directory).
6. Considering that you've generated Makefiles using cmake, you can run 'make'
to build the package.
7. Run 'make install' to install the package. 

Also, you can run 'make uninstall' to uninstall the package.

Documentation
=============
After creating build files, there will be two extra targets (if you have their
requirements): doc and pdf. If you want to create API documentation (using 
doxygen) you can run 'make doc'. To create PDF documentation, run 'make pdf'.
