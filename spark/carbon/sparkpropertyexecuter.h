/*!
 \brief ISimControl derived class that executes read and write accesses for SparkProperty::Property objects in its parent thread.

 Property objects are interface objects to functions of SimSpark.
 Reading data by calling getter functions and writing data by calling setter functions is only safe if done by the SimulationServer thread, so the
 thread cant change data of the Simulation while it is accessed externally.
 Read and write update calls of a Property are queued in a PropertyExecuter which calls the implementation of the Get/Set access in the Spark PropertyControl
 assigned with this executer as soon as a simulation cycle of the GuiSimControl node the executer is registered to ends.\n

 Accessing the Get- and Set-Queue is done with a stepped wait system.
 The Simulation Server will only wait for an extremely short time to access the Set- or Get-Queue.
 If the access attempt fails because of a timeout the normal server simulation is continued and will try to access the queue again in the next cycle with
 successively increasing wait time.
 This way the Simulation is guaranteed to not spend to much time waiting for the main thread even in case of some Gui-Element or interaction flooding the
 input queues.
