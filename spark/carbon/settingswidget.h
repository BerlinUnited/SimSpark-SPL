 \brief Base Class for Widgets that contain setting control Gui elements.

 SettingWidgets are provided to the SettingsDialog and are displayed there under a
 topic name and page name.
 SettingWidgets can be designed and implemented like any other gui element but it is
 strongly encouraged to implement the virtual functions applyChanges(), undoChanges(),
 updateSettings() and the signal settingChanged() as well as the slot updateSetting().
 This way all widgets are guaranteed to work the same way. They allow changing and
 reverting setting changes freely and applying them using the SettingDialogs apply button.

 The SettingsWidget communicate with the creating plugin/frame using a Settings object.
 If the SettingsWidget only contains Settings that should be kept over several program starts
 (should be the usual case) the creator can use the global Settings object for this purpose.
