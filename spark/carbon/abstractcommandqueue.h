 \brief A Queue that can contain and execute AbstractCommand objects.

 Commands derived from AbstractCommand can be queued in an CommandQueue so the command can be executed by a another
 thread than the one creating the command.

 CommandQueues derived from AbstractCommandQueue (e.g. MyCommandQueue) should correspond to a set of Commands derived from a
 AbstractCommand derived class (e.g. MyCommands). So the type id field in AbstractCommand can be used as class identification.

 Command objects are queued with queueCommand(). For every queue and execution access the command queue has to be locked with a
 Semaphore using lockQueue() and unlockQueue(). Locking/Unlocking is done automatically, but keep in mind, that you might not be able to
 access the queue immediately.
