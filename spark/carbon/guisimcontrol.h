/*!
 \brief oxygen SimulationControlNode for the Gui. Coordinates execution of Gui functions by the Simulation threads.

 A SparkController creates a single GuiSimControl node and registers it into the node tree.
 So the Gui has a single node entry in the zeitgeist node tree of a simulation.

 Plugins and other sources can create ISimControl objects and add them to the GuiSimControls node list.
 The GuiSimControl node is called whenever a simulation cycle
 or wait cycle is executed (when a Simulationcontrol event happens). Then it calls the respective functions of registered
 ISimControl objects.

 This way the SimulationThread executes the code defined in the virtual functions of the ISimControl derived class.
