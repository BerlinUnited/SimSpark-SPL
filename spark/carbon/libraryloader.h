/*!
 \brief Class that manages include directories and files for plugin and main window shared libraries.

 The library loader contains a list for include directories and single include files.
 All shared library files (*.dll, *.so) contained in the file list or one of the include directories are added to a library map.

 Managed libraries can be linked to the application.
 With exportPlugins() and exportLayout() the loader calls the export functions for Plugins or QMainWindows that are defined as external
 C function in the shared library using EXPORT_PLUGINS_BEGIN and EXPORT_PLUGINS_END of abstractplugin.h as well as EXPORT_LAYOUT of windowmanager.h.

 The LibraryLoader is used by the PluginManager to import plugins and the Carbon to import a main window.
