RELEASE News of rcssserver3d-0.6.3 (In progress)

* Most notable changes:
 - Name change: simspark -> rcssserver3d. To make the functionality more clear.
 - No internal monitor by default. Run rcssmonitor3d separately to see the game.
   As another option, you might run rcsoccersim3d which runs both 
   rcssserver3d (simspark) and rcssmonitor3d on the local machine. 
 - Added HMDP effector/perceptor
 - Some compilation fixes
 - Improved Windows support 
 
You can get the package on the Simspark page on SourceForge
at http://sourceforge.net/projects/simspark/
