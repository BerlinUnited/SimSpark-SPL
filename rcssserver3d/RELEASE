RELEASE News of rcssserver3d-0.7.2

New changes for the RoboCup 2019 competition:

* Pass Mode:

Pass mode is a new playmode that can be initiated by an agent of a team, in
which the corresponding team gets some extra privileges for a short amount of
time in exchange for some constraints to increase the possibility of a
successful pass.
Once pass mode for a team has been issued the following happens:
    - The playmode changes to "pass_left" or "pass_right" depending on which
      team has initiated the pass playmode
    - The opponent team is prevented from getting within a certain distance of
      the ball which is the same as the minimum distance any opponent can be
      from the ball for the passmode to be initiated (default 1.0 meters)
    - The pass playmode will end as soon as a player touches the ball or a
      certain amount of time has passed (default 4 seconds)
    - After pass mode has ended the team who initiated the pass mode is unable
      to score for a certain amount of time (default 10 seconds) -- if a team
      does score within that time the opponent is awarded a goal kick just as
      if a goal had been scored off an indirect kick

The pass command will only be successful if the following conditions are met:
    - The current playmode is PlayOn
    - The agent issuing the pass command is within a certain distance of the
      ball (default 0.5 meters)
    - No opponents are within a certain distance of the ball (default 1.0
      meters)
    - The ball is stationary as measured by having a speed no greater than a
      certain amount (default 0.05)
    - A certain amount of time has passed since the last time the agent issuing
      the pass command's team has been in pass mode (default 3 seconds)


* Self Collisions:

Self collisions (collisions between body parts of an agent) are now detected
without the use of a physics engine and penalized with loss of control of the
involved limbs (default) or beaming the agent to the side.
This is achieved by freezing joints involved in a self collision for
SelfCollisionJointFrozenTime, and then unfreezing the joints and let them be
controlled again before being potentially flagged for another self collision
for SelfCollisionJointThawTime. Each joint is monitored individually such that
only those joints involved in a self collision can be specified as needing to
be frozen. Currently all joints in an arm or leg are frozen if any box collider
in that arm or leg is involved in a self collision. The penalty for a self
collision can be changed to beaming an agent if desired. Additionally an output
file can be specified to write self collision info to.


* Rectangular Goals:

    - Changed goal colliders to resemble a rectangular shape
    - Added new object files and the corresponding material definition files
      for visualizing rectangular goals
