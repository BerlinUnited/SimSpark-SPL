RELEASE News of rcssserver3d-0.7.1

New changes for the RoboCup 2017 competition:

* Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed bug where double touches on kicks (kickoffs, free kicks,
      kick-ins, corner kicks) were not always being detected correctly
    - Fixed bug where if a player is touching the ball right when the wait
      time at the beginning of a kick play mode ends the play mode could end up
      recording the touch and inadvertently end the kick.
    - Fixed bug where if two players enter their own penalty area at the
      same time, and in doing so cause the maximum allowed number of players in
      the penalty area to be exceeded, both players will be called for illegal
      defense even if the team is only one player over the allowed number of
      players in the penalty area.
    - Fixed issue where free kicks and kicks-in printed an error message
      and didn't behave correctly if the ball has yet to be touched by an agent.

* Rule Changes:
    - The automated referee will no longer move/reposition agents on top
      of each other or into their own penalty area if it will trigger an illegal
      defense penalty.  This is accomplished by doing a breadth first search
      around the position that an agent is to be repositioned to until a safe
      position is found.   The number of positions that will be considered by
      the breadth first search is bounded by the MaxNumSafeRepositionAttempts
      value (default 100) in naosocersim.rb.  Setting this value to 0 turns this
      feature off.  If ever the server isn't able to safely reposition a player
      it will print an error message.
    - The order in which players are evaluated for fouls and are penalized
      is now randomized so as to not have any bias associated with players'
      teams and uniform numbers.
    - Averaging the velocity of an agent over the last 3 time steps
      instead of 5 when determining charging fouls.  This allows agents to
      reduce their effective velocities faster so as to have a better chance of
      avoiding charging fouls when colliding with an opponent.
    - Removing code that takes into account the opponent's velocity moving
      away from a colliding agent when determining fouls.  This code was
      decreasing the likelihood of an agent being called for a foul when running
      down an opponent from behind.
    - Turning off crowding rules in naosoccersim.rb
    - Adding StartAnyFieldPosition flag (default false) to
      naosoccersim.rb.  Turning this flag on allows agents to be at, beam, or be
      moved to any position on the field at the start of kickoffs including the
      opponent's side of the field.
