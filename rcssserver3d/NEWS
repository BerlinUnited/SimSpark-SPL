[0.7.1]
New changes for the RoboCup 2017 competition:

* Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed bug where double touches on kicks (kickoffs, free kicks,
      kick-ins, corner kicks) were not always being detected correctly
    - Fixed bug where if a player is touching the ball right when the wait
      time at the beginning of a kick play mode ends the play mode could end up
      recording the touch and inadvertently end the kick.
    - Fixed bug where if two players enter their own penalty area at the
      same time, and in doing so cause the maximum allowed number of players in
      the penalty area to be exceeded, both players will be called for illegal
      defense even if the team is only one player over the allowed number of
      players in the penalty area.
    - Fixed issue where free kicks and kicks-in printed an error message
      and didn't behave correctly if the ball has yet to be touched by an agent.

* Rule Changes:
    - The automated referee will no longer move/reposition agents on top
      of each other or into their own penalty area if it will trigger an illegal
      defense penalty.  This is accomplished by doing a breadth first search
      around the position that an agent is to be repositioned to until a safe
      position is found.   The number of positions that will be considered by
      the breadth first search is bounded by the MaxNumSafeRepositionAttempts
      value (default 100) in naosocersim.rb.  Setting this value to 0 turns this
      feature off.  If ever the server isn't able to safely reposition a player
      it will print an error message.
    - The order in which players are evaluated for fouls and are penalized
      is now randomized so as to not have any bias associated with players'
      teams and uniform numbers.
    - Averaging the velocity of an agent over the last 3 time steps
      instead of 5 when determining charging fouls.  This allows agents to
      reduce their effective velocities faster so as to have a better chance of
      avoiding charging fouls when colliding with an opponent.
    - Removing code that takes into account the opponent's velocity moving
      away from a colliding agent when determining fouls.  This code was
      decreasing the likelihood of an agent being called for a foul when running
      down an opponent from behind.
    - Turning off crowding rules in naosoccersim.rb
    - Adding StartAnyFieldPosition flag (default false) to
      naosoccersim.rb.  Turning this flag on allows agents to be at, beam, or be
      moved to any position on the field at the start of kickoffs including the
      opponent's side of the field.

[0.7.0]
A new GUI application is developed to run and control simspark simulations.
Additinoally, there are a number changes to the soccer rules enforced in
the simulator. More details about changes in this release follows:

* Updates to charging foul model and other fouls:
An initial implementation of the charging foul model is documented at
http://www.acso.uneb.br/bahiart/uploads/Main/FoulModel2016.pdf.  The
following are some updates to the charging foul model which will hopefully
be added to the documentation of the charging foul model soon:

  - Rules for charging involving agents' relative positions to the ball
    are only active for agents within 1 meter (ChargingMaxBallRulesDist) of
    the ball
  - Players are immune to committing a charging foul after touching the
    ball for 1 second (ChargingImmunityTime)
  - There is no maximum distance from the ball that a charging foul will
    be called -- charging fouls can be called at any position on or off the
    field
  - After a player is moved/beamed by the server no charging fouls in any
    collision involving that agent will be called for 1 second after the
    player is moved.
  - There is no longer a concept of ChargingMinCollisionPoint.  Instead a
    threshold of velocity  exerted in a collision (ChargingMinCollisionSpeed
    with a default value of 0.2) must be exceeded for a charging foul to be
    called.  This value is calculated as a cross product between an agent's
    velocity vector and the normalized vector from the agent to the average of
    the opponent agent and collision point.

General foul changes:

  - For visualization purposes after any foul (charging, crowding, illegal
    defense, touching, incapable) agents are lifted up in the air for
    FoulHoldTime (default 0.5 seconds) before being beamed to the sideline.
  - Touching fouls in groups of three or more are no longer called on
    goalies (a goalie's teammate will be called for a touching foul instead).


* New kick rules:

The following is a summary of the rule changes for kicking:
  - A player taking a kick can't touch the ball more than once before
    another player touches the ball -- touching the ball more than once
    results in an indirect free kick for the opponent (same as in human
    soccer).  Note that a goal kick doesn't count as having been taken until
    the ball leaves the penalty area
  - You can never score an own goal directly off your own kick -- the
    result of such an own goal is a corner kick for the opponent (same as in
    human soccer).
  - Kick-ins are indirect (same as throw-ins in human soccer).
  - Goal kicks and corner kicks are direct (same as in human soccer).
  - Scoring a goal directly from an indirect kick results in a goal kick
    for the opponent (same as in human soccer).
  - Kickoffs are still indirect and the ball must be touched outside the
    center circle, or an opponent must first touch the ball, before the team
    taking a kickoff can score (in human soccer kickoffs are direct, but this
    artificial rule is needed to prevent "kickoff taking contests").
  - Players within KickRepelDist (defined in naosoccersim.rb) of the ball
    when it is placed for a kick are moved back to a position exactly
    KickRepelDist from the ball to prevent players from accidentally touching
    the ball and losing a kick if the ball is placed right underneath their
    current position on the field.
  - Two new direct kick playmodes have been added
    (direct_free_kick_[left|right]).  While there is no plan to use these
    playmodes at this year's competition, shift+L and shift+R key bindings for
    them have been added to rcssmonitor3d and roboviz.


* Keepaway mode:

The keepaway playmode sets the playmode to GameOver if a player on the
right team touches the ball or if the ball leaves a predefined keepaway
area. During keepaway no charging fouls will be called on agents on the
right team (the team trying to take the ball).

The keepaway mode adds the following parameters to naosoccersim.rb:

// if in keepaway mode
Keepaway
// center X value of keepaway box
KeepawayCenterX
// center Y value of keepaway box
KeepawayCenterY
// length of keepaway box
KeepawayLength
// width of keepaway box
KeepawayWidth
// reduction rate of length of keepaway box per minute
KeepawayLengthReductionRate
// reduction rate of width of keepaway box per minute
KeepawayWidthReductionRate


* Blocking of say messages with illegal characters:

While most agents have been sending legal say messages, there have been a
few instances of agents sending say messages with illegal characters.  The
server now throws out say messages containing illegal characters (space,
parenthesis, and those outside the range [0x20-0x7E]).  The server also
prints an error message containing the illegal say message and the agent
who said it.  When running in sync mode the proxy still needs to be used
to protect against bad say messages that break parsing (or really any
unparseable messages sent to the server) -- this change only throws out
say messages with illegal that were able to be parsed.


* Plugin for drawing objects in roboviz:

You can activate a new plugin (rvdraw) within rcssserver3d allowing it to
draw objects in roboviz by using the "-DRVDRAW=ON" command line argument
when running cmake before building rcssserver3d.  The plugin likely only
works in linux which is why it isn't enabled by default.  Currently this
plugin is set to draw debugging information for the charging foul model,
but one might find it useful to add their own code to the server to draw
things in roboviz.

After rcssserver3d is compiled with the rvdraw plugin enabled use the
following command line argument when running the server to have it send
draw commands to roboviz:
rcssserver3d --rvdraw-host <roboviz_host_machine>


[0.6.10]
This is the final release of rcssserver3d for RoboCup 2015, which brings a few
bug fixes and enhancements for the competitions:
   * Turning off penalty shootout mode as soon as a goal is scored by the left
     team so that a later second goal won't be recorded if the goalie leaves
     the penalty area after the goal was scored.
   * Added models for visually differentiating between different robot body
     types.  This changes some of the black coloring on the robot's body to be
     a different type dependent neutral color.
   * Fixed bug where the server may hang on certain systems if beam effector
     noise (BeamNoiseXY and BeamNoiseAngle) are set to 0.

[0.6.9]
This release comes with a number of bug fixes and also adds some new features
to enhance managing games and also to add more challenges to games, most notably
adding noise to the beam effector. The changes are:

* Rule Changes:
  - Added new rule requiring that the ball must either touch an opponent, or
    touch a teammate outside the center circle, before a team taking a
    kickoff can score.
  - Penalty shootout kickoffs are direct now.

* New Features:
  - Added noise to the beam effector with the amount of noise added controlled
    by the 'BeamNoiseXY' (in meters) and 'BeamNoiseAngle' (in degrees)
    values in naosoccersim.rb.  Noise is added to beam X and Y values from
    a uniform distribution within the range [-BeamNoiseXY, BeamNoiseXY]
    and to beam angle values from a uniform distribution within the range
    [-BeamNoiseAngle, BeamNoiseAngle].
  - Added new training command parser commands for setting the game time and
    score.  They are the following commands:
        (time <time>)
        (score (left <score>) (right <score>))
  - Added penalty shootout mode where a goal is awarded to the left team
    (penalty kicker) if the right team's player (penalty goalie) leaves the
    penalty area.

* Bug fixes:
  - Fixing a bug with free kicks where as soon as the ball was touched,
    and the playmode transitioned from freekick to play on, the ball was
    still moved back to the location of the freekick preventing the ball from
    being directly kicked out of a free kick. Also ensuring that the ball
    position for free kicks is updated correctly as this wasn't happening
    right after the ball was placed back at the center of the field after
    a goal was scored.
  - Fixing a bug where a player would be incorrectly called for double
    touching the ball on a kickoff if the player first kicked the ball
    directly in the opponent's goal from a kickoff, resulting in no goal
    being awarded a nd the opposing team being given a kickoff, and then is
    the next player to touch the ball in the PlayOn playmode after a dropball
    when the opponent doesn't take their kickoff.
  - Fixing a bug where rules such as too many players in their own penalty
    area was not being enforced.

[0.6.8.1]
This is a bug-fix release for 0.6.8, which had a bug in labeling hear messages.
It also includes few other changes: a small bug fix, and new hetero robot types
for RoboCup 2014. Now, our Nao robots can have toe! :)

[0.6.8]
This release mainly comes with 2 new features: 1. labeling hear messages with
team names so that it is clear which team the message comes from. 2. Score
reporting. A few bug fixes are also included. 

* Hear message labeling: 
  - Now hear messages include team names - Ex: (hear teamName 9 10 text)
  
* Score Reporting:
  - Example: (GS (unum 8) (team left) (sl 1) (sr 2) (t 0.00) (pm BeforeKickOff))

* New Options in naosoccersim.rb:
  - LabelMessages - Toggles on/off labeling of messages (default on)
  - ReportScores - Toggles on/off score reporting (default on)
  - MaxRobotTypeCount - Maximum number of any one robot type that may be 
    used (default 7 and can be set to 11 to preserve 2013 competition behavior)
  - MinRobotTypesCount - Minimum number of robot types that must be used for a
    full team (default 3 and can be set to 1 to preserve 2013 competition
    behavior)
  - MaxSumTwoRobotTypes - The maximum sum of robots for any two robot types
    (default 9 but can be set to 11 to preserve 2013 competition behavior)
   
* Other changes:
  - Robot type checking to ensure that enough robot types (3) are used and that
    not too many of any one (7) or two (9) types is used.
  - Updating naorobottypes.rb with robot types used in 2013 competitions
  - Clear Players in GoalLeft/Right before kickoff to make sure that opponent
    doesn't touch ball at the middle of the field.
  - Don't enforce crowding rules on kickoff, since opponent should not come
    near the ball

[0.6.7]
This is the RoboCup 2013 release. It comes with some bug fixes, and also
compatibility with latest Boost libraries. New fouls and new debugging
facility are provided. Now, fouls are sent to the monitor so that it can
provide visual feedback about them. Finally, support for heterogeneous robots
is added and two sample types are provided. 

* Heterogeneous Players:
  This release supports heterogeneous players. Currently, two extra Nao robots
  are provided beside the standard Nao (thanks Stefan and Klaus).
  
  - Usage: to use the new heterogeneous players, a new scene command should be
  used. While the old style scene commands work, for using hetero players you
  should send "(scene rsg/agent/nao/nao_hetero.rsg TYPE_NO)", in which TYPE_NO
  is the type number of the player type. Type 0 is the standard type, and
  hetero types start from 1. Therefore, to load Nao type 1 the following
  command should be sent: (scene rsg/agent/nao/nao_hetero.rsg 1). Notice that
  you can use the new style command for loading standard Nao, using 0 as
  TYPE_NO.
  
  - Heterogeneous Robot Parameters: The robot parameters for different types
  are defined in a new file: "naorobottypes.rb". New types can be added to the
  array. But to define new parameters, corresponding .rsg files should be
  modified.
  
  - Rules: Each team can use a limited number of hetero players. The limits
  can be configured in naosoccersim.rb using "MaxTotalHeteroCount" and 
  "MaxHeteroTypeCount" variables. The former limits the total number of hetero
  players for each team, and the latter specifies the maximum number of players
  of a single hetero player type.

* Other Features/Changes:
  - Charging fouls rules are added (thanks Patrick). These fouls are not
  penalized, but recorded and sent to the monitor. New rules can be configured
  in naosoccersim.rb.
  - Fouls are added to the monitor protocol to provide visual feedback about
  them to viewers.
  - For debugging purposes, sensing the orientation of the agent can be 
  enabled using "setSenseMyOrien" option in the .rsg file of an agent (added 
  by Patrick)
  - A player can kick the ball in kickoff if there are only 2 players in
  the field to support current penalty mode.
  - Fixed bugs in goal counting when changing team sides in the second half.
  Now, this feature should work fine. However, it is disabled by default now
  since we don't use it currently in the competitions.

[0.6.6]
It's time for a new release! This release comes with a number of bug fixes and
several minor enhancements here and there. Now, you can run the server for 
two complete halves. Teams now change their sides in the second half. Also, 
automatic kick off and automatic quit modes are added. Field dimensions are
also increased to 20x30 meters, and free kick distance is 2.0 meters now.
More detailed information about this release follows:

* Rule Changes:
 - automatic referee now enforces rules whenever players are permitted to 
   play, rather than only in playon play mode.
 - it is no longer possible to score directly from kick off, the ball should 
   at least touch another player before going into the goal
 - in kickoff playmode, the kicker cannot touch the ball again until another
   player touches it.

* Field/Dimension Changes:
 - New dimensions: 20x30
 - Free kick distance: 2.0
 - Corner kick position: in the middle point between goal and corner of the 
   field, to facilitate faster corner kicks.
 - Nao's foot height is now 0.02 rather than 0.03. Ankle's position changed 
   accordingly

* Several Bug fixes. Some notable ones are:
 - Penalty lines and middle circle are now visible at their actual position
   (Thanks to Marcus for his bug report, and Sander).
 - Fixed a small bug in parsing move paramter (Thanks to Andreas Seekircher)  
 - Fixed a mistake which prevented from touch group rules to be applied at all 
 - Fixed a small bug in goal counting which cause this function to always
   count a goal when ball moved out of the field 

* Enhance Automatic Kickoff Support:    
 - Changed default value of 'WaitBeforeKickOff' to 30, since 5 seconds
   is too small for any team to start.
 - WaitBeforeKickOff is now calculated from when the first agent connects
   rather than from the beginning of the before kickoff playmode (when the
   simulator is started)
 - A game can be started with kick off for the left team, or using 'coin toss'
   to determine which team should start the game. CoinTossForKickOff variable
   in naosoccersim.rb can be used to change the behavior. It is disabled
   by default. 

* Enhance Support for 'Second Half':
 - Automatic Kick Off mode assigns Kick off to the correct team in the second
    half
 - Change teams' sides in the second half if enabled (enabled by default). It
    can be disabled using ChangeSidesInSecondHalf variable in naosoccersim.rb.

* Automatic Quit:
 - In Automatic Quit mode rcsssever3d shuts down automatically when the game
   is over. It is disabled by default but can be enabled using 'AutomaticQuit'
   variable in naosoccersim.rb

* Other Enhancements:
 - The location of init scripts (e.g. zeitgeist.rb) can now be specified using
  --init-script-prefix (you still can put most of the scripts and data files
  like rsg/ directory inside your ~/.simspark/ instead).
 - Better Windows support
 - Support creating Windows binaries under Linux using MinGW

[0.6.5]
This release comes with a number of enhancements and some bug fixes. Most 
notably, the automated referee is improved to prevent many agents to collide
with each other which is required for running games with more players. Also, to
better suite the field for running 9 vs 9 games, the field size is increased
and it is 21x14 now. There are some visual improvements and minor enhancements 
to improve the general experience with the simulator. Finally, simspark.rb is
renamed to rcssserver3d.rb for more consistency.  

* New touch rules:
The automated referee now enforces two new rules to better prevent crowding and
a high number of collisions in 9 vs 9 games:
- If an agent is in touch with more than 2 agents (including himself), and he
  wasn't in such a situation in the previous time step - which means he is the
  last to join the group - he is relocated outside of the field. However, if
  the number of opponents in the group are more than teammates, an unspecified
  opponent will be relocated instead.
- If it is not clear which agent joined the group last, e.g. when 3 players
  were all separate at time t, but were all touching each other in time t + 1,
  an agent is chosen at random for relocation.

* Other Enhancements:
- Visual improvements in rcssmonitor3d: new field texture, colored team names
  and scores
- Set different agent and monitor ports with --agent-port and --server-port
- Bigger field size: 21x14
- Updated PDF documentation
- Bug fixes, specially in the automated referee
- New Trainer command (killsim) to terminate the simulator
- Compilation fixes
- Nao robots now sense visual information about field lines by default
- Now you should change the value of enableRealTimeMode variable in 
  rcssserver3d.rb if you want to turn off using real time mode

[0.6.4]
This release is supposed to be the final version of rcssserver3d for
RoboCup 2010 in Singapore. The release includes a referee patch contributed
by FCPortugal team which enforces some rules to avoid crowding of many players
in a small area and to penalize ill-behaved players. Additionally, this 
release comes with some more facilities for a human referee to control the game
and individual players in the field.

* New keys in rcssmonitor3d:
- n: Cycle through agents. A red marker disc shows which agent is currently
  selected
- e: Clear selection
- lctrl+s: Go into specific-agent-selection-mode. A specific agent can now be
  selected by pressing l or r and then a number. So the sequence 'lctrl+s, l, 4'
  selects the agent with uniform number 4 of the left team
- m: Move selected agent FreeKickDist meters back
- x: Kill selected agent

* Other changes:
- Improved referee to enforce more fair games
- Visual Studio 2010 compilation fixes
- Agents can sense field lines if enabled (currently disabled)

[0.6.3]
In this release, we are preparing for a simulation with more robots than before.
The current target is to have 6 vs 6 games, so we have made some changes to
make the simulator more suitable for it. The most notable changes made in
rcssserver3d package in this direction are:
1. Disabling the internal monitor by default: starting from this version, the
simulation server (simspark binary, now called rcssserver3d) no longer brings
up a monitor when run. To actually view the simulation, a monitor (e.g.
rcsmonitor3d which is included in this package) should be run separately. This
separation noticeably improves the performance of the server. A new executable
called "rcsoccersim3d" is provided which runs both the simulation server and a 
monitor on the local machine. 
2. Bigger field: in this version, field dimensions and goal width are 1.5 times
larger than before to provide enough area for 6 vs 6 games.

* New names:
  - rcssserver3d: the old simspark binary has been renamed to rcssserver3d, as
    it more clearly shows the functionality of the simulator. A symbolic link
    called simspark is provided for compatibility.
  - rcsoccersim3d: as stated above, running rcssserver3d (formerly simspark)
    no longer starts a monitor to view the simulation, and a monitor should be
    run separately. For users' convenience a new executable called rcsoccersim3d
    is provided which runs both rcssserver3d and rcssmonitor3 to connect to
    the running simulator. 

* Other notable changes:
 - Added HMDP effector/perceptor
 - Some compilation fixes
 - Improved Windows support 

[0.6.2]
This release is mainly a bug-fix release, and is the last release before
RoboCup 2009 competitions.

* Some improvements:
 - improved Windows and MacOSX support
 - improved external monitor
 - fixed a bug in rcssserver3d's goal counting
 - added right kick-off key to the monitor (Simon Raffeiner)
 - simspark can take command line argument specifying the rb script to run
   (using --script-path command line option)

[0.6.1]
This is the first release of the simulator after RoboCup 2008 competitions,
and the first release of rcssserver3d package as a separate package which 
uses simspark package to implement a hunamoid soccer simulation environment.
In this version of the simulator, restricted vision perceptor is enabled again,
and is going to be used in 2009 competitions. You can read more about this
perceptor in 0.5.9 NEWS section.
Finally, we do not use autotools for our build system anymore. You should use
CMake (version 2.6) to build the package. See INSTALL for further installation
instructions.

* Restricted Vision: 
  - restricted vision perceptor is installed on Nao.

* New requirements for building the pacakge:
  - You'll need CMake 2.6 to configure and build the package
  - this package depends on simspark package, so you should install it first

* New program names:
  - agentspark is now called rcssagent3d
  - monitorspark is now called rcssmonitor3d

* Some small enhancements and bug fixes 

[0.6]
This release is the final version for RoboCup 2008 in Suzhou China. It
is little different from version 0.5.9 in simulation, excepting some
changes for the rule of RoboCup 2008, including the vision perceptor.
And also, the eye-catching sky and goal are added. The monitor
protocol is improved due to the team requirement.

* Physics:
 - set ball angluar drag to 0.00005

* Vision perceptor:
 The old vision perceptor (just the same as last year) is used for
 both Nao and soccerbot058.

* Eye-Catcher:
 - the sky box is added
 - the goal with net is added

* Monitor Protocol ( Thanks Carlos from Borregos3D):
 - Add 'move' command for setting the agent's position and rotation.
   The whole command may like this:
   (agent (team $teamname)(unum $id)(move $x $y $z $dir))
   where, ($x, $y, $z) is the desired position, and $dir is the
   desired face direction of the robot. 
 - Fix bug in set ball command.

* Rule bug fix:
 - fix bug of the goal kick position
 - fix bug of the size of penalty

[0.5.9]
This release is the candidate of RoboCup 2008. There are some
important improvements. Firstly, the physics parameters are well
adjusted to make the simulation more real and stabler. Secondly, the
restrict vision perceptor is used, with which the vision range is
limited, but more details will be seen, i.e. the head, hands and feet
of robots can be seen. Furthermore, the soccer rule and visual
features are improved.

* Physics Parameters:
 Some physics parameters are adjusted to make the simulation more real
 and stabler.
 - Joint parameters: the max force and max speed of the joint are
 restricted, and some other parameters are modified.
 - Ball parameters: the parameters of drag are modified.

* Restrict Vision: 
 The restrict vision perceptor is installed both in nao and
 soccerbot058. This perceptor have some restriction compared with
 original vision perceptor. Firstly, the robots can only see object in
 the limited angle range (both horizontal and vertical angle ranges
 are [-60, 60] in degree). Secondly, the frequent is restricted, the
 robot can get one vision message every 3 cycles. Furthermore, note
 that the noise is added to the vision information.

 However, the information is richer: the robot's torso, head, hands
 and feet can be seen. The flags placed in the field can also be seen
 (They are no visual in the screen now, but the robot can see them).
 Four flags are placed at the field corners (the height is 0), and the
 four flags are placed at the goal posts (the corner of the goal).

* Visual:
 - The Nao robot can be identified by team colors and numbers. You can
 play a match with Nao robots ;-)
 - the monitor camera can be controlled by number keys (from 1 to 7)

* Soccer Rule:
 - Field Size: the field size is 12mx8m, the center circle radius is
1.3m, the penalty size is 1.2mx4m. More information please see
naosoccersim.rb.
 - Kick Off: the kicking off team can enter the center circle, and the
   opponents will be moved away from the center circle.

[0.5.8]
 In this release, we have a simulator which is much more like the
 RoboCup Humanoid League: The smaller size, the smaller robot and
 ball. The integrated agent is added as a new feature. Furthermore,
 the external monitor works now.

* New Robot Models:
 - Nao: robot from Aldebaran Robotics, see rsg/agent/nao/nao.rsg. The
 robot looks great with textures.
 - soccerbot058: robot based on soccerbotcomp with joint limits, and
   its size is scaled ( default 0.1 ), see
   rsg/agent/soccerbot058/soccerbot.rsg.
 
* New Nao Soccer Simulation:
 The simulator start naosoccersim.rb in default now, the new field
 size is the same as RoboCup Standard Platform League, please see
 naosoccersim.rb for details. The old soccersim.rb are still there,
 you can switch between naosoccersim and soccersim in simspark.rb.

* New Feature:
 - Integrated Agent: The agent can run internally now, in this case it
 is easier to debug the skill that you have designed, since it can get
 the simulation information directly. Note that the action is
 performed with a delay of one cycle (This is just like external
 agent). There is an example in plugin/soccer/agentintegration. To run
 the demo just enable two lines in the simspark.rb:
 sparkSetupTrain()
 addIntegratedAgent('SoccerbotBehavior',1)

* Important Fixes:
 - the external monitor works now, you can run to monitor remotely(set
 $monitorServer in spark.rb). And also, the internal monitor can be
 disabled by setting $enableInternalMonitor to false in simspark.rb.
 - the OBJ importer is extended, we have really good 3D graphics now.
 - joint limits: the simulation runs stably with joint limits.

For details have a look into the ChangeLog coming with the package.

[0.5.7] 
 This is the first release after the competition in Atlanta.
 The simulator now contains the auto-adjust speed mode(by default),the
 server will run slower when needed, and print warning. We also
 applied changes what be made in Atlanta, and re-enabled the
 communication between robots. Furthermore, we imported some new
 features from SimSpark Project, including rsgedit, rosimporter, and
 etc. Although they are optional, you may want to try the rsgedit,
 please install the wxWidgets[1] firstly and take a look at the 'Quick
 start to RsgEdit' in the doc directory. Finally, there is a new robot
 model which is built with composite bodies for better performance.
 The monitor logger was also bug-fixed and improved. With the help of
 the community, the documents about the server are available now, but
 they are still in progress.

* Documents:
 - the user's manual in doc/users
 - the server developer's manual in doc/devel
 - there are also some useful information at SimSpark Wiki[1]

* Important fixes:
 - mointor logger:
  - fixed methods to work properly.
  - solve the update problem (reported by team Apollo).
  - remove invisible nodes to save  bandwidth(thanks to Carlos
    Bustamante from Borregos3D).

* Features:
- applied Atlanta 2007 server changes:
               - 'm' and 'c' for killing agents
               - two robot models with different facilities
               - using materials with textures
               - free kick distance changed to 4.5
               - one half time (8 mins)
               - agents can beam in Goal_Left or Goal_Right play modes
               - no longer possible to move agents by pressing m
- re-enabled communication, the soccerbot056 has SayEffector and
 HearPerceptor
- add AdjustSpeed mode (It is enabled by default). In this mode, the
 server will run slower when needed.
- new multi-threaded implementation
- rosimporter, model importer for RoSiML[2] modeling language
- rsgedit, a cool simspark simulator with graphic user interface.
- soccerbotcomp, the new robot mode which is built with composite
 bodies, it can advance the simulation speed.
- include some useful utilities: tinyxml, wxflatnotebook and wxscintilla

For details have a look into the ChangeLog coming with the package.

[0.5.6]
This is the final release for the competition in Atlanta, GA. The simulator
now contains the new timer running in single-threaded mode by default. We also
fixed the soccer rules plug-in (communication and offside not supported
yet). Furthermore, we completed the game state info display in both the
internal and external monitors, and fixed the trainer command parser to work
with the new agents. The SoccerBot model was modified, the performance was
slightly improved, and several bugs were fixed.

* Important fixes:

beameffector & singlematiniteffector:
- fixed beaming with rotation

gyrorateperceptor:
- output is now in the local coordinate system of the robot

trainercommandparser:
- fixed several methods to work with the new agent

* Features:

- new GameTimePerceptor added which senses game time instead of sim time (not
  used in Atlanta)
- GameStatePerceptor added which provides the agent with information about the
  current game state (play mode, game time, unum, and side)
- play modes and rules re-integrated (no communication and no offside yet)
- slight performance improvement by caching references to important classes
- game state info display fixed in the internal and external monitors
- key bindings for 7 different camera positions, kick off, and drop ball
- the SoccerBot was modified to have a two-part torso to facilitate stand-up
  motions, it got colliders (and very small masses) at the hands, it uses the
  ForceResistanceReceptor instead of the TouchPerceptor
- the hinge joint and universal joint effectors will not set any velocity if a
  joint stop is reached to prevent large forces and instabilities (not used in Atlanta)
- the maximum joint velocity that can be requested was restricted to 9000
  deg/sec (for stability reasons)
- Field size was reduced to 50m x 32m, penalty area reduced to 8m x 19.5m
- Goal size was increased to 9m width and 4m height
- The ball model was improved according to suggestions from wjq and Tobias Warden
- The visualization of the corner flags was moved back to allow proper corner kicks


[0.5.5]
The simulator has been ported to MacOS, the network messages were shortened,
we did some performance tuning, improved the log player, added a new perceptor,
and fixed some bugs.

* Important fixes:

simspark:
- fixed setup of goal flags (thanks Carlos)
- several files were missing break statments in the physicsserver directory
  (thanks Shivaram)

gyrorateperceptor:
- "rt" keyword was added to enable correct parsing of the perceptor values

* Features:

- MacOS compatibility (please see README.MacOS file for comments)
- individual ODE CollisionSpaces are used to encapsulate each agent and 
  each goal now
- the protocols for the monitor and the agents have been shortened
- new basic importer for Wavefront OBJ files
- textures can be enabled for the ball, the field, and the agent torso
  (player numbers :-) )
- several computationally expensive function calls have been replaced
  with calls to more efficient versions
- the log player now plays logfiles in forward and backward mode, and 
  supports pause, and forward/backward stepping
- a new perceptor (ForceResistancePerceptor) was implemented that gives 
  feedback about position and resulting force due to a collision of the 
  body the perceptor is attached to   (see doc/TEXT_INSTEAD_OF_A_MANUAL.txt 
  for details)
- BeamEffector now takes 3 arguments: position (x and y) and angle in the
  x-y-plane (rotation around z-axis) at the beam position (DEG)

[0.5.4] 
This release contains fixes for known problems (e.g. in the
visionperceptor or the spark sample agent), updates of old plug-ins
for the new simulation (beameffector, initeffector), and new features
like a log player, and new perceptors.

* Important fixes:

visionperceptor: 
- patch (vision6) by Yuan to fix problems related to the local 
  reference frame of the robot

soccerbot:
- anchor of the ankle joint was set higher to avoid foot penetration
  when doing large steps (thanks Guangbin Cui)

beameffector:

[0.5.3] 
This release contains some fixes for the offside code and some
eye candy for the lite monitor. Furthermore, it includes the new
Fujitsu HOAP-2 inspired robot for simspark as well as the derived
SoccerBot (work in progress), and some improvements to the physics
code (mainly related to stability issues).

* Features:

- rcssmonitor3D-lite features a SkyBox (by Heni Ben Amor) and improved 
  colors and lights (by Tobias Warden). Please see the comment about
  texture files in the INSTALL file.
- simspark includes hoap2.rsg and soccerbot.rsg robot models
- agent communication was restricted to a message length of 20 Bytes in
  rcssserver3D

* Important fixes:

- toggling pause with p (r will be used for assigning free kicks)
- correct aspect in 2D overview
- Mousehandling patch (by Junqing Wang)

rcssserver3D:
- several fixes for the offside rule code
- fixed bug that prevents arguments to be passed to SPADES (by Sander van Dijk)

simspark:
- fixed bug in the sceneffector that resulted in a crash if defines were used in RSG
  agent descriptions
- modified several parameters of the physics system to get a more stable simulation
- fixed the fixed joint type ;-)


[0.5.2]
This is mainly a bug fix release to get a stable version and change some parameters
for the RoboCup-2006 in Bremen. Some new features, mainly in the monitor are
introduced as well.

* Features (general):

- the catch margin of the catch effector has been reduced to 0.8m and the goal
  height was increased to 1.6m to reflect the stronger goalie capabilities and
  offside rule implications.
- the monitor features a new autocam mode, "picture-in-picture" view, a
  display of the current camera mode, and the ground texture can be toggled
- logfiles can now be stepped backwards
- agenttest was updated with a say command and sample code

* Important fixes:

- the calculation of the torque vector in the kickeffector was fixed
- the parameters for the pan/tilt effector are checked for NAN
- the list of the monitor keybindings was updated
- a bug in offside was fixed that could occur if a player and the ball cross the
  opponents line of defense, and this player was the last one to shot the ball
  before crossing.
- the code has been updated for gcc 4.1
- some bugs relating to kickoff have been fixed
- say effector ignores some illegal characters


[0.5.1]
Release 0.5.1 contains mainly two fixes:
- the Offside rules are now closer to the FIFA rules. 
- the RestrictedVisionPerceptor (RVP) was hardly useable. The RVP 
  can now be controlled by using a PanTilt Effector.


[0.5]
This release introduces a few new features, and also some bugfixes 
(and probably some new bugs :). Important new features and fixes are 
as follows:

* Features (soccer):

- Goalies. 
  Players with uniform number '1' can catch the ball using the (catch) 
  command. 

- A restricted vision perceptor, so that not all other agents are
  visible at the same time. With this perceptor, the communication
  introduced in the 0.4 release becomes important.

- The offside and some other rules have been cleaned up and some bugs
  have been removed. Also, files that have been missing in the
  0.4. release are now present.

- rcssmonitor3D-lite looks a little more interesting now, and 
  some bugs with the random number generators have been fixed.

* Features (general):

- a couple of new physics functions have been added, general simulation 
  settings have been fixed. This doesn't change the current soccer 
  simulation, but is important for the general simulator.


[0.4]
This release includes some speed improvements, agent communication,
an implementation of the offside rule, and a first, unfinished version
of the new legged-sphere agent type amongst other things. 
Here is a summary with some more details:

* Features (general):

- A cache for node references has been added to the Zeitgeist
  core to speed up the simulation considerably. Thanks go to the
  Brainstormers3D team for the initial patch and to Markus Rollmann
  for the modification and integration.
- The Spark based simulation (which will be used in the future for
  simulations using the articulated agents) has been made much more
  flexible by Markus Rollmann.
- A sample agent and behaviors for a Spark based soccer simulation
  using either small cars or legged-sphere agents has been
  added. Currently, the legged-sphere agents are used by default. 
  The behavior of the agents is very simple (in the legged-sphere case) 
  and is solely meant to demonstrate how to use the new perceptors and 
  effectors.

* Features (soccer):

- The offside rule has been implemented by Hesham Ebrahimi
- Agent communication is now possible. It is based on the
  2D communication model. Documentation can be found in the
  file doc/TEXT_INSTEAD_OF_A_MANUAL.txt. Thanks go again to
  Hesham Ebrahimi for the implementation and documentation
- The lite-monitor is able to draw velocities in 2D and 3D. 
  Added by Jan Murray.

* Important fixes:

- Fix for gcc 4.0 and above compatibility by Jan Murray
- An issue with 64bit builds, reported by Li Yang and Patrick Riley,
  was fixed by Markus Rollmann
- The distance error in the vision perceptor was made dependent on the
  real distance by Oliver Obst

[0.x.x]
This release has been ported to OS X.  Besides the normal
requirements, it requires an X server to be installed on the machine,
along with a glut library for X windows.

[0.3]
This release is intended to be used as official version on RoboCup 2004.
With respect to the soccer rules, this release mainly fixes some bugs contained
in the 0.2.2 release. New things here are both an automatic and a manual drop 
ball feature and physical goal posts.
With respect to the simulation system itself and usability, a few keys have 
been added to the rcssmonitor3d-lite and the system shuts down automatically
after a match is over. Printing messages is turned off by default now (can be
changed by adding log streams from a ruby file).
Bugs that have been fixed included some math things (like a bug in the setup of
axis aligned bounding boxes), bugs in the use of SPADES, and in the sample 
agent communication server.

[0.2.2]
This release adds both soccer simulation specific features (like better rules 
 and an initial version of a logplayer) and general simulation features 
(almost all ODE features are supported now, and an initial version of an
alternative simulation server as a SPADES replacement). For the 0.3 release,
some of these new features need some polishing :-). Below a short summary of 
new features. 

* Features (soccer):

- The rcssmonitor3D protocol has been changed to produce less redundant data. 
  Specifically, field flags will only be sent once, and information like team 
  names and scores will be sent only if they change.
- rcssmonitor3D-lite can be used as a logplayer now. To do this, replace the 
  CommServer plugin setup in rcssserver3D-lite.rb by the LogfileServer setup.
  Monitor logfiles get recorded by SPADES automatically, and the new monitor
  protocol can be used as Logfile format.
- The rcssmonitor3D - library got an user-friendly interface.
- rcssmonitor3D-lite looks better now and the display is more informative.
- The body and effector parameters have been changed based on suggestions from
  the mailing lists.
- A trainercommandparser has been added so that it is possible to use soccer
  monitor applications as trainer program (to repoduce specific situations etc).
- Players are moved away from the ball in certain situations (like kick in for 
  the other team or kick off, etc).
- It is possible to do automatic kick offs now (in rcssserver3D.rb).
- Due to various improvements and changes, the simulator is now reasonable fast
  to extend the half time length to 4 minutes; suggestions for the competition 
  match lenght are welcome. 
- Players accelerate (and break) faster; something like air resistance or 
  friction was added to the players and the ball so that they eventually stop 
  with no acceleration.
- The torque from the kicker was made configurable from rcssserver3D.rb
- An experimental say-effector has been added; up to now, only monitors 
  (and trainers implemented as monitors) can hear the messages.

* Features (general):

- Several types of ODE joints are supported now.
- An initial version of a generic simulation server has been added. It 
  reimplements some of the more general SPADES concepts (like network support 
  and a run loop). It is intended to use it as an alternative to SPADES when 
  reproducibility of events is not key. The advantage is that faster 
  simulations (or simulations with more agents) are possible by less overhead.
- A general description language for 3D simulations has been added. By using
  this description language, it is possible to set up different 3D simulations
  based on text configuration files. Simulations are described by sets of 
  S-Expressions (any other format possible by changing plugins).
- The ScriptServer has been changed so that ruby functions can also read back
  values from the simulator easily.
- Body controllers have been introduced. Body controllers can be used to 
  constrain/control the motion of associated bodies (things like adding drag 
  forces or changing the "bouncyness" of objects can be controlled).
- Added a tool that visualizes the internal zeitgeist class hierarchy.
- Added a new library libspark that contains an application framework for
  applications using both liboxygen and libkerosin classes. 
- Added a new application SimSpark. SimSpark is a monolithic simulator bases
  on libspark. With this new simulator, we have been testing most of the new
  generic features (like the description language and ODE joints) we have been
  adding. 
- Got rid of the rcssbase package dependency. The "net" part of this package
  is part of rcssserver3D now and has been extended by TCP sockets. The list 
  of required libraries should be reasonable small now.
- Added simspark demo simulations. 

* Important fixes/Changes (both soccer specific and general):

- The simulator compiles with recent versions of boost (tested with 1-31-0).
- Goals are properly counted now.
- Goals are only 50cm heigh now because agents cannot jump high. 
- The default torque from the kicker is low now (was way to high before).
- Building the API documentation has been reduced to only the necessary cases.
- Some math bugs in libsalt have been fixed.
- The kerosin library has been overhauled (lights / meshes / etc).
- Added support to update cached script variables after reading ruby files.

[0.2.1]
This is a bugfix release. It removes some (but not all) bugs found
in rcssserver3D-0.2.

- Configuration was made a little stricter and more complete so that
  it should be easier to install the whole thing.
- The missing agenttest.rb file is included into the distribution
- The Makefile.am's have been fixed for those not building the libkerosin part.
- A fix for the recent SPADES versions has been added.
- A major bug with the weight of objects in the simulation has been removed.
  The dynamics of the drive of the robots and of the kicker have been adapted.
  (This bug was found after a report from Nuno Lau on the sserver list).
- The artificial slowdown of bodies has been removed. 
- The default timer of the sample agents (agenttest) is now jiffies.

A few features have been added to the zeitgeist library. This is mostly stuff 
dealing with the ruby interface.


[0.2]
This release adds already big parts of the soccer specific parts to the 
simulator. All soccer specific things are realized as plugins to the 
simulator, they are located in the soccer bundle in plugin/soccer/.

- rcssmonitor3D and soccer simulation:
  Starting with our simple monitor: here are the most visible changes.
  You can see a soccer field with two goals, a ball and agents in different
  colors dependend on the side they are playing on. 
  You can use keys 'a', 's,', 'd', and 'w' to move the camera (as was as 
  the mouse). The monitor can send simple commands to the simulator now.
  ('k' is of kick off, that is what you probably wanted to know).
  The soccer field is a standard FIFA size field with variable size, same with
  the ball and goals.
- Soccer Plugins
  Here is the really big part of the changes. Agents have an (omni-)drive and 
  a kicker now, they can perceive the environment with a kind of 360ओ omnicam
  and they get updates about the game state and things like the battery state.
  Using the omnidrive, agents can do 100m in something about 13s or 14s.

On startup, the simulator will start two different types of agents now. Even 
though there are only a few soccer rules implemented, it should be possible
to implement a simple soccer team. To facilitate programming a new team, we 
enhanced the sample client a bit. 

Finally, we added a small text (lacking a comprehensive manual),
describing the basic features of the simulated robots in the simulation. 

[0.1]
This is the initial release of rcssserver3D. To get an idea of what
rcssserver3D provides in general, please see also the file README.

- liboxygen / libkerosin
  libkerosin, the library containing the big part of the simulation
  system has been split up. We have now liboxygen containing the
  pure simulator part, and libkerosin containing the graphical output,
  user input and stuff like this. Because of issues with different
  OpenGL drivers, libkerosin is currently not used for graphical
  output. Another advantage of the split into liboxygen and libkerosin
  is that we can have a standalone simulator with no graphics.
  By default, libkerosin will not be build (if you want to build it
   anyway: libkerosin needs a few other libaries. See the
   documentation for details).

- SPADES integration
  For handling agents as external processes, we integrated SPADES into
  the simulator. SPADES is a middleware system for agent-based
  distributed simulation and was introduced by Patrick Riley on the 
  RoboCup 2002 symposium. Among other things, the simulator gets a
  model of simulation time and support for external monitors by using
  SPADES.  

- GameControlServer
  We added a GameControlServer as central instance for keeping
  information and classes relevant to agents in a simulation. An
  important part of the GameControlServer is a reference to a 
  parser responsible for parsing messages from agents into an internal
  representation. Parsers can be plugged in into the
  GameControlServer, so the simulator does not depend on a fixed
  protocol. Parsers are also responsible for generating messages from
  the internal representation.

- S-Expressions parser
  As a specific instance of a pluggable parser, we implemented a
  parser for parsing and generating S-Expressions (lists as used in 
  functional programming languages like LISP or Scheme). We also
  discussed using XML as protocol between agents and simulator. There
  was no clear joint position for or against XML or
  S-Expressions. There is no XML parser module now because noone
  implemented it :)

- CreateEffector
  We added a CreateEffector. The idea behind the CreateEffector is
  that once the agents connected to the simulator, they do not have a
  physical representation, other effectors or perceptors yet. By using
  the CreateEffector, agents can request specific effectors,
  perceptors, and bodies. Right now, the create effector requests a
  default agent with a perfect vision sensor, a simple force effector,
  an InitEffector for changing the team name, and a sphere like body.

- simple external monitor
  To get an impression of what actually happens we implemented a
  simple external monitor based on simple OpenGL stuff (it does not
  use our libkerosin library). The external monitor also uses
  sexpressions as syntax. The protocol is even more preliminary 
  than the agent protocol...

- a simple external SPADES agent
  We also implemented a very simple agent as sample implementation for
  external agents. The sample agent does (almost) nothing.

- ...

[Demo]

Physical Simulator as shown on RoboCup 2003 symposium
=====================================================
- libzeitgeist
  A class object system as core of the simulation system. A class
  object is just a factory of class instances. In addition to this
  mechanism, it also implements an object hierarchy. This hierarchy is
  essentially a virtual file system, where the 'directories' and
  'files' are instances of C++ classes. These two concepts are quite
  intertwined with each other, as class objects can also live inside
  the object hierarchy. Objects within the hierarchy are identified
  with a unique name. Class objects can also be loaded as plugins
  (loadable modules).

- libkerosin
  A physical simulator for simulation of rigid body dynamics based on
  ODE. We created a library that contains the big part of the
  simulator including visualization, physics, geometry, agents. We can
  also handle user input and playing sounds. The simulator library
  build upon the class object system mentioned above.

- demo
  A demo application with some spheres as agents. Agents try to get
  some food. The agents are part of the simulator loop; a simulation
  step is over if all agents finished thinking. Because of this, agents
  have infinite thinking time (in priciple). There is no model of time.
