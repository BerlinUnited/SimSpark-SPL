/*! \mainpage rcssserver3D Documentation
 *
 * \section welcome Welcome!
 *
 * Below are some links to pages containing useful information regarding
 * the actual implementation of rcssserver3D.
 *
 * - <b><a href="developers/implementation.html">Implementation</a></b> This
 *   section gives an overview of how the source code distribution
 *   is structured. It also explains how the projects can be built. Refers to
 *   the Windows version, so it is unfortunately already dated a bit.
 *
 * - <b><a href="developers/howtos.html">HowTos</a></b> This is probably
 *   the most useful section as it describes how to go about using the
 *   framework developed to realize custom simulations. For example, how do you
 *   implement a class which can live in the object hierarchy (and make it
 *   loadable from the Ruby script side).
 *
 * - <b><a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sserver-three-d"></a>rcssserver3d list</a> The mailing list on sourceforge.net.
 *
 * - <b><a href="http://www.uni-koblenz.de/~fruit/publications/KO03a.html">Simulation League: The Next Generation</a></b> The extended version of the paper
 *   presented at the RoboCup Symposium 2003 in Padova.
 *
 * - <b><a href="http://www.uni-koblenz.de/~fruit/ftp/teaching/koe03-diplomarbeit.pdf">Thesis PDF</a></b> Diploma thesis of Marco Kögler (in PDF format)
 *   describing the concepts of a framework for simulating and visualizing
 *   agents in 3D environments.
